# Passage
A main feature which I feel is worth discussing on the topic of cozy games is their level of in-game difficulty. All games typically have some level of difficulty which changes as players progress, intended to complement the learning curve. Of course, some genres, most notably Soulsbornes, take this to the extreme and turn it into the main feature of the game. When it comes to cozy games, the majority of the time, developers choose to make the game ‘easy’ compared to these hardcore genres, further promoting these feelings of happiness and comfort, rather than purposefully igniting frustrations and rage. In this way, I consider the Soulsborne genre to be a perfect contrast towards cozy games. Where cozy games aim to promote feelings of warmth and comfort, the Soulsborne genre throws all this out of the window, forcing players into uncomfortable situations filled with bleak atmospheres, permanent loss of items, swathes of enemies and gigantic bosses, with the sole intent of igniting anger in the players. Bringing this back to the topic of coziness, devs in the industry have recognised that much like these soulsborne games which cater to a specific hardcore playerbase, there is another playerbase who desire the vibe of coziness which, in terms of being the main selling point of a game, has been missing for some time.

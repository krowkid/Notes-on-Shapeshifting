###### Deontological Theory
Deontological theory, derived from the Greek word 'deontos' meaning duty, is a moral philosophy that emphasizes acting according to moral principles rather than personal desires or preferences. It is associated with the work of Immanuel Kant and does not rely on divine authority for moral guidance. According to deontological theory, the right thing to do is to act based on principles, out of duty, and according to self-imposed laws. The intention of the actor, rather than the consequences, is considered essential in determining the moral goodness of an action.

In deontological theory, there is a difference of emphasis between duty and rights. Duty focuses on the person performing or refraining from an action, while rights focus on rational and autonomous individuals and the respect owed to them. Duty examines the nature and extent of our obligations, including distinctions between acts and omissions, and intention and foresight. Rights, on the other hand, prioritize individuals' ability to make their own decisions and determine the course of their lives.

There is a morally and legally significant difference between an act and an omission. For example, killing a person is considered an act, while letting them die is considered an omission. However, a person may still be held liable for the consequences of an omission if they are under a duty to act. Intentionally bringing about a bad consequence is considered wrong. However, it is not always wrong to foreseeably do so. In some cases, bad side-effects are seen as an inevitable part of our good purposes. For instance, it is morally and legally acceptable to act without the intention to kill but with the foreseen side-effect of accelerating death, which is known as the principle or doctrine of 'double effect'.

Deontological theory is a normative ethical theory that holds that the rightness or wrongness of an action is determined by whether it conforms to a set of moral duties or obligations. While deontological theory has many strengths, it has also been criticized on a number of grounds.

One criticism is that acting out of duty seems incompatible with freedom. Deontological theory emphasizes the importance of following moral imperatives and acting according to principles, rather than acting based on personal desires or preferences. Some argue that this restricts individual freedom and autonomy.

Another criticism is that it is difficult to determine how we would all choose the same moral imperatives. Deontological theory suggests that there are universal moral principles that should guide our actions. However, it can be challenging to establish a consensus on what these principles should be, as individuals may have different perspectives and values.

Deontological theory has also been criticized for its inadequate role for the emotions. Emotions play a significant role in human decision-making and moral judgments. Critics argue that deontological theory's focus on duty and rationality may overlook the importance of emotions in ethical decision-making.

Additionally, deontological theory has been criticized for only providing a framework for ethical decision-making. It does not offer clear guidance on how to resolve conflicts of duty or make specific moral judgments in practical situations. This can make it challenging for individuals to apply deontological principles to real-life scenarios.

Finally, deontological theory has been criticized for its difficulty in resolving conflicts of duty. In situations where there are conflicting moral obligations, it can be challenging to determine which duty should take precedence. This lack of clarity in resolving conflicts of duty can make it difficult to apply deontological principles consistently.

Despite these criticisms, deontological theory remains an influential ethical theory. It offers a clear and concise framework for thinking about moral obligations and duties. Additionally, deontological theory is appealing to many people because it emphasizes the importance of individual autonomy and responsibility.

###### Consequentialist Theory
The sanctity of life principle is a philosophical and theological concept that accords inherent dignity and intrinsic worth to human beings. It is applied in law and practice to protect innocent human life, but it does not require life to be preserved at all costs. In the context of medicine, the focus is on the worthwhileness of treatment for the patient, rather than the worthwhileness of the patient's life itself.

Consequentialist / Utilitarian theory is a normative ethical theory that judges the rightness or wrongness of an action based on its consequences, rather than its intentions. The theory focuses on maximizing overall pleasure or happiness, and judging actions according to their probable outcomes. John Stuart Mill is a prominent advocate of this theory, building on the work of Jeremy Bentham. Mill argued that the morally right action is the one that leads to the greatest happiness for the greatest number.

While consequentialist theory has many strengths, it has also been criticized on a number of grounds. Some of the key criticisms include:

- **Problems of calculation**: It can be difficult or even impossible to define and measure the good, calculate and compare complex consequences, and consider present and future consequences.
- **Incompatibility with justice**: The theory can override individual interests in favor of the greater number, which raises concerns about justice. Rule utilitarianism attempts to mitigate this issue by emphasizing the importance of following rules that promote the greatest good for the greatest number, even if in some cases this may lead to unjust outcomes.
- **Inadequate weight to human dignity and individual rights**: Critics argue that the theory reduces moral importance to pleasure and pain, leaving individual rights conditional and not adequately considering human dignity.
- **Insufficient guidance in practical situations**: Some argue that the theory lacks clear guidance for resolving conflicts of duty and does not sufficiently account for emotions or provide practical guidance.

###### **Virtual Theory**
Virtue theory, based on the writings of Aristotle, focuses on character and the right way to be rather than the rightness or wrongness of an action. It emphasizes the qualities or excellences of character that enable a person to flourish over their lifetime. Virtues are ways of thinking, feeling, and acting appropriately in specific situations, which are discovered and learned through practice. Examples of virtues include justice, temperance, wisdom, courage, honesty, generosity, and kindness.

Some criticisms of virtue theory include the lack of a reliable account of what constitutes human flourishing and the lack of clarity on what counts as a virtue. Additionally, there is no clear guidance provided in practical situations.

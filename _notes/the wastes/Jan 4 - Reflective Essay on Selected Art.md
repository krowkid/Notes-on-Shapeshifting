# Quotes

1. "I have been sick my whole life."
2. "And there it came: his half smile."
3. "As I walked out of the ICU, I felt that old state of mind consuming me... that feeling of not being taken seriously by those who had your life in their hands."
4. "Have you been sick for a while?"
5. "This book is, it turns out, a miracle book, because it wrote its own ending. It didn’t believe in my bows, my full circles, my pretty arcs, my character development."
6. "Part of the difficulty in writing Sick was that I was quite sick during the making of it, and continue to be … You are reading the middle of the story, I suspect, but I’m not sure where or when it will all end, so one might as well tell it now."
7. “Because my illness at this stage has no cure, I can forever own this discomfort of the body. I can always say this was all a mistake. To find a home in my body is to tell a story that doesn’t exist. I am a foreigner, but in ways that go much deeper than I thought, under the epidermis and into the blood cells.”
8. “It reminded me that illness will always be with you as long as life is with you. And tragedy will be with you too.”
9. “It is no coincidence then that doctors and patients and the entire Lyme community report—anecdotally, of course, as there is still a frustrating scarcity of good data on anything Lyme-related—that women suffer the most from Lyme. They tend to advance into chronic and late-stage forms of the illness most because often it's checked for last, as doctors often treat them as psychiatric cases first. The nebulous symptoms plus the fracturing of articulacy and cognitive fog can cause any Lyme patient to simply appear mentally ill and mentally ill only. This is why we hear that young women—again, anecdotally—are dying of Lyme the fastest. This is also why we hear that chronic illness is a women's burden. Women simply aren't allowed to be physically sick until they are mentally sick, too, and then it is by some miracle or accident that the two can be separated for proper diagnosis. In the end, every Lyme patient has some psychiatric diagnosis, too, if anything because of the hell it takes getting to a diagnosis.”
10. “And the deal with so many chronic illnesses is that most people won't want to believe you. They will tell you that you look great, that it might be in your head only, that it is likely stress, that everything is okay. None of these are the right things to say to someone whose entire existence is a fairly consistent torture of the body and mind. They say it because they are well-intentioned usually, because they wish you the best, but they also say it because you make them uncomfortable. Your existence is evidence of death. . . .”
11. “Love is the only good way many of us know how to feel alive.”
12. “Was all the hardship there to demonstrate how unlucky I was, or was I actually a very lucky person given that I'd survived so much?”
13. “Because my illness at this stage has no cure, I can forever own this discomfort of the body. I can always say this was all a mistake. To find a home in my body is to tell a story that doesn’t exist. I am a foreigner, but in ways that go much deeper than I thought, under the epidermis and into the blood cells.”
14. My full-time job became my health,” Khakpour writes. “None of the doctors spoke to each other, specialists were piled on top of specialists, each tugging and turning me in their own directions," she bemoans.
15. Survival, she reminds us at the end of Sick, can be an act of the imagination: it is the courage to insist on seeing yourself decades in the future, climbing a mountain, squinting into the sun, sitting down at the desk to write what happened.

patient-provider communication on lyme disease 


Porochista Khakpour has been sick her whole life. Diagnosed with Lyme disease in 2012, Khakpour details the challenges of her late-stage disease in her memoir "Sick". She highlights its terrifying symptoms, and the difficulty in being believed due to controversies surrounding the illness. Unlike any illness narratives I've read, "Sick" doesn't offer certainty about the disease's nature and expresses that true wellness isn't easily achievable and can't be distilled into simple solutions. That's why, upon reflection, what I think it means to be a doctor is that you have to be a continuous learner and be a patient advocate. 


**CONTINOUS LEARNING**

**Link to Memoir?**
Establishing a Lyme disease diagnosis remains a considerable challenge, as many symptoms are nonspecific and there are currently no definitive diagnostic tests available. 

“[Lyme disease] tends to advance into chronic and late-stage forms of the illness most because often it's checked for last, as doctors often treat them as psychiatric cases first. The nebulous symptoms plus the fracturing of articulacy and cognitive fog can cause any Lyme patient to appear mentally ill and mentally ill only simply. This is why we hear that young women—again, anecdotally—are dying of Lyme the fastest. This is also why we hear that chronic illness is a women's burden. Women simply aren't allowed to be physically sick until they are mentally sick, too, and then it is by some miracle or accident that the two can be separated for proper diagnosis. In the end, every Lyme patient has some psychiatric diagnosis, too, if anything because of the hell it takes getting to a diagnosis.”

“Upon hearing it so nakedly, upon having it corroborated, I found myself trying to second-guess him. It had been years of people not believing in me and my illness, and suddenly I couldn’t accept it myself.”

**Importance and Reflection?**
The field of medicine is a dynamic and ever-evolving discipline, where knowledge, techniques, and technologies are constantly advancing. In this fast-paced environment, the importance of continuous learning in medicine cannot be overstated. Emphasises that Healthcare professionals must embrace lifelong learning to stay current, provide the best possible care to their patients, and remain at the forefront of their specialties. Continuous learning empowers healthcare providers to make more informed decisions, resulting in better treatment plans and ultimately, improved patient outcomes.

# Compilation

I had been to the hospital so many times for my Lyme disease, not just explaining but overexplaining, as if I had something to hide. Lyme is a disease that many in the medical profession, unless they specialize in it, find too controversial, too full of unknowns, to fully buy it as legitimate. It’s thought of as the disease of hypochondriacs and alarmists and rich people who have the money and time to go chasing obscure diagnoses. For years I’d become used to dealing with all sorts of skeptics whether in person or online, but it never stopped being frustrating. I’d always catch myself getting preemptively ready to argue, feeling a defensive heatedness from years of impossible experiences with so-called medical professionals. It was always a risk, me getting into it, and yet I had no choice. I had the script down as if it was a script and not my reality. My case is a CDC-level Lyme case, I’d learned to say, which was true, hoping doctors would understand I was one of the small percent of Lyme sufferers who actually had the luxury of CDC recognition, what the rest hope for. I’m not like those

Usually they would land on this idea: the truth is we know very little about this illness. It would drive me crazy, as if it were all guesswork, and I’ve found that I’ve never completely abandoned doubting it. But there’s something I’ve held on to, that I’ve heard from more than one doctor: the link between chronic illness and PTSD. If post-traumatic stress disorder can be defined as “a mental health condition that’s triggered by a terrifying event—either experiencing it or witnessing it (symptoms may include flashbacks, nightmares and severe anxiety, as well as uncontrollable thoughts about the event),” according to the Mayo Clinic, then it makes sense that it can trigger a relapse or surfacing of some disability or illness. The disability or illness itself could cause the PTSD, and the experience of going for years undiagnosed and then misdiagnosed as many like myself do can cause considerable trauma, to put it mildly.

The test results seemed off here and there, but there was no consensus. The doctors tossed around hypothyroid, insulinemia, repeated Firoozeh’s PCOS suspicion, and echoed anxiety and depression. They tried to put me on thyroid medications, birth control, antidepressants. I was given a blood sugar monitor and was told to measure my blood sugar several times a day and keep a food diary. I did that, but none of it led to anything conclusive and definitive.

“As I walked out of the ICU, I felt that old state of mind consuming me, taking me back to my time in so many other hospitals, and the anger at being misunderstood boiled up in me again, that feeling of not being taken seriously by those who had your life in their hands. All the many times, the people who shook their heads at Lyme, who looked at me with pity for my circumstances, who could barely stifle their rolled eyes. I’d tried to avoid this hostile world of hospital rooms and doctors’ offices for years, but it haunted me. Here I was again, with something unrelated to Lyme and only two choices—to come clean or to hide, but I knew every decision would have something to do with my diagnosis. It amazed me that even after all these years, with all the time that had passed, as I managed to stay out of the medical system for the most part, and my fluency in their language still being proficient, that I could still be in this position—helpless, crazy-seeming, confusing, inconvenient, out of their norm, a problem. And not one worth the time to be solved.

“A large part of my treatment was owed to alternative therapies—in the end, Dr. Canfield’s treatments worked because he was able to pair more conventional antibiotic therapy with all sorts of out-there therapies that “you had to go off the grid for.”

“I also considered that it was because of bad fortune, because whatever was wrong with me was not to be uncovered in my lifetime, and I began to wonder how many others throughout history had given up because life had given them no choice. Knowledge could not be expected, but one didn’t need to tolerate life without it either.”

"Then she shows us the oceanic mess that is chronic illness, a story without a clear origin or a neat arc, and we see how it becomes an ongoing presence—not a narrative at all. We are forced to consider what it must be like to live like this, to leave aside all our illusions of fairness, logic, and contro.

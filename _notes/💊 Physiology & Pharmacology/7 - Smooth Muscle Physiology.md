###### **PART 1**
Smooth muscle is found in various organs throughout the body, each with its unique function. The iris and ciliary body, for instance, are equipped with smooth muscle to adjust the pupil's diameter and facilitate lens focusing, thus regulating the amount of light entering the eye. Meanwhile, in the fallopian tube, smooth muscle orchestrates the transportation of eggs from the ovaries to the uterus. In the uterus, specifically in the myometrium, smooth muscle takes on the pivotal role of orchestrating labor and parturition. The vas deferens relies on smooth muscle to assist in delivering sperm for ejaculation. Moreover, the detrusor muscle in the bladder, along with the ureters and urethra, are responsible for urine storage and micturition. Throughout the gastrointestinal tract, smooth muscle is a prevalent feature, ensuring the mixing and propulsion of gastrointestinal contents. Blood vessels, including arteries, veins, and arterioles, benefit from the presence of smooth muscle to regulate blood flow and control vascular tone. In the airways, smooth muscle governs the airway diameter, enabling the regulation of airflow.

Smooth muscle-containing tissues, particularly arteries, have a specific structure that allows them to perform their functions effectively. The structure of smooth muscle-containing tissues, such as arteries, can be described as follows: Arteries consist of three main layers: the tunica intima, tunica media, and tunica adventitia. The tunica intima is the innermost layer and is composed of endothelial cells that line the lumen of the artery. The tunica media is the middle layer and contains smooth muscle cells. These smooth muscle cells are arranged in a circular fashion around the artery and are responsible for regulating the diameter of the blood vessel. The tunica adventitia is the outermost layer and is composed of connective tissue that provides support and protection to the artery.

Smooth muscle cells in arteries have a unique structure. They are elongated in shape and lack striations, unlike striated muscle cells. Smooth muscle cells have dense bodies, which anchor actin filaments. These dense bodies are similar to Z-lines in cardiac muscle and are composed of a-actinin. Smooth muscle cells also have an endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum (ER/SR) that stores calcium ions (Ca2+), which are essential for muscle contraction. Gap junctions are present between smooth muscle cells, allowing for the flow of current and small molecules between cells. The structure of smooth muscle-containing tissues, particularly arteries, allows for the regulation of vascular tone and the control of blood flow. The contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle cells in the tunica media of arteries play a crucial role in maintaining blood pressure and distributing blood throughout the body.

The structural differences between smooth muscle (SM) cells and striated muscle cells are quite pronounced. Smooth muscle cells are elongated in shape and lack the characteristic striations seen in their striated muscle counterparts. They possess a single nucleus, centrally located within the cell. In smooth muscle cells, dense bodies serve as anchor points for actin filaments, somewhat akin to the Z-lines found in striated muscle cells, and these dense bodies are primarily composed of α-actinin. Additionally, smooth muscle cells house an endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum (ER/SR) where calcium ions (Ca2+), vital for muscle contraction, are stored. In contrast, striated muscle cells exhibit a cylindrical shape with multiple nuclei distributed at the cell's periphery. Their hallmark feature is the distinct striations, alternating dark and light bands, which become visible under a microscope. Striated muscle cells are distinguished by well-developed transverse tubules (T-tubules) that penetrate deep into the cell, facilitating the rapid transmission of action potentials. They possess a sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) that plays a key role in storing and releasing calcium ions (Ca2+) crucial for muscle contraction. Notably, striated muscle cells contain sarcomeres, which represent the fundamental contractile units of the muscle. Sarcomeres consist of overlapping actin and myosin filaments, enabling them to slide past each other during muscle contraction.
###### **PART 2**
Smooth muscle cells exhibit a distinctive response to the activation of Gq-coupled receptors through a sequence of cellular events. This process can be summarized as follows:  Gq-coupled receptors, which are located on the cell surface, come into play when specific ligands, such as neurotransmitters, hormones, and autacoids, bind to them. This binding event initiates a signaling cascade within the smooth muscle cell. Once Gq-coupled receptors are activated, the associated G protein triggers the activation of an enzyme called phospholipase C (PLC). PLC's role is to cleave phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into two important second messengers: inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3, one of the second messengers, binds to receptors on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), which is a specialized organelle for storing calcium ions (Ca2+). This binding event prompts the release of Ca2+ ions from the SR into the cytoplasm. The increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration is a critical trigger for the contraction of smooth muscle.

In the activation of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), the elevated cytoplasmic Ca2+ binds to calmodulin, forming a complex known as Ca2+-calmodulin. This complex then activates myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), an enzyme responsible for phosphorylating the regulatory light chain of myosin. The phosphorylation of the myosin light chain allows myosin to attach to actin, initiating the cross-bridge cycling and, consequently, muscle contraction. With the phosphorylated myosin, cross-bridges form between myosin and actin filaments. This results in the sliding of actin and myosin filaments, leading to the shortening of the smooth muscle cell. Importantly, this contraction can occur in a graded manner, depending on the level of cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration and the degree of MLCK activation. It's noteworthy that the regulation of smooth muscle cell contraction can also be influenced by other signaling pathways, such as the cyclic AMP (cAMP) pathway, which is activated by Gs-coupled receptors. 

Smooth muscle cells relax in response to nitric oxide (NO) and the activation of Gs-coupled receptors through the following mechanisms: NO is a potent vasodilator that is released by endothelial cells in response to various stimuli, such as shear stress or neurotransmitters. NO diffuses into smooth muscle cells and activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase (GC), leading to the conversion of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) into cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). cGMP activates protein kinase G (PKG), which phosphorylates various target proteins, including ion channels and myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP). Phosphorylation of MLCP leads to the dephosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC), resulting in relaxation of smooth muscle cells. Both NO-mediated relaxation and Gs-coupled receptor-mediated relaxation ultimately lead to the dephosphorylation of MLC, which reduces the sensitivity of myosin to calcium and inhibits smooth muscle contraction.

Membrane depolarization promotes contractility in smooth muscle cells through a combination of steady-state modulation of membrane potential (Em) and firing of action potentials, depending on the type of smooth muscle. In some types of smooth muscle, such as vascular smooth muscle, steady-state modulation of Em plays a significant role in contractility. Changes in Em can be induced by various stimuli, including neurotransmitters, hormones, and autacoids. Depolarization of the smooth muscle cell membrane leads to the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), allowing calcium ions (Ca2+) to enter the cell. The influx of Ca2+ triggers the release of additional Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), leading to an increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration. This increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration activates the contractile machinery, resulting in smooth muscle contraction. 

In other types of smooth muscle, such as gastrointestinal smooth muscle, the contractility is influenced by the firing of action potentials. These action potentials are generated by pacemaker cells or driven by depolarization of the smooth muscle cells themselves. The upstroke of the action potential is primarily due to the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), leading to an influx of Ca2+ into the cell. The increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration triggers smooth muscle contraction through the activation of the contractile machinery.

The regulation of the crossbridge cycle in smooth muscle (SM) differs from that of striated muscle. In striated muscle, the crossbridge cycle is regulated primarily by the binding of calcium ions (Ca2+) to troponin, which leads to the exposure of myosin binding sites on actin and subsequent crossbridge formation. This process is known as the sliding filament mechanism. In smooth muscle, the regulation of the crossbridge cycle is more complex and involves the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain (MLC). The key regulatory step in smooth muscle contraction is the phosphorylation of MLC by the enzyme myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). Phosphorylated MLC allows myosin to bind to actin, initiating the crossbridge cycling and muscle contraction.

The phosphorylation of MLC in smooth muscle is regulated by the intracellular concentration of calcium ions (Ca2+) and the activity of MLCK. The increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration, either through the influx of extracellular Ca2+ or the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, activates MLCK, leading to the phosphorylation of MLC and subsequent contraction. In contrast, the relaxation of smooth muscle is primarily mediated by the dephosphorylation of MLC, which is regulated by the activity of myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP). MLCP removes the phosphate group from MLC, leading to the detachment of myosin from actin and relaxation of the smooth muscle.

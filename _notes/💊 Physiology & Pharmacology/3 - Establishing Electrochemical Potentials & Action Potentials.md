###### **PART 1**
In a resting neuron, the concentration of Na+ is higher outside the cell than inside, while the concentration of K+ is higher inside the cell than outside. The concentration gradients of these ions across the membrane and the membrane permeability to each type of ion determine the resting membrane potential of the neuron. The resting membrane potential is a voltage across a neuronâ€™s membrane that is established when the neuron is not sending or receiving electrical signals. The resting potential is close to the equilibrium potential of K+ because the membrane is much more permeable to K+ than to Na+. 

Electrical events in excitable cells can be measured using various techniques, including patch clamping, intracellular recording, and extracellular recording. Patch clamping involves sealing an electrode to the cell surface, allowing for precise measurement of ion currents and membrane potential changes. Intracellular recording involves inserting an electrode inside the cell to directly measure electrical activity. Extracellular recording involves placing an electrode outside the cell to measure the changes in electrical activity.

Cell membranes are selectively permeable, meaning they allow certain substances to pass through while restricting the passage of others. Cell membranes contain ion channels that allow the selective movement of ions across the membrane, contributing to the generation and propagation of electrical signals. Cell membranes establish and maintain electrochemical gradients, which are essential for various cellular processes, including the generation of the resting membrane potential and action potentials. The cell membrane has a resting membrane potential, which is the voltage difference across the membrane when the cell is at rest. This potential is established by the differential distribution of ions across the membrane. Cell membranes contain ion pumps, such as the Na+/K+-ATPase pump, which actively transport ions against their concentration gradients, contributing to the establishment and maintenance of the resting membrane potential.

Potential difference refers to the voltage or electrical potential across the cell membrane. It represents the difference in charge between the inside and outside of the cell. This potential difference is essential for the generation and propagation of electrical signals in excitable cells. Current refers to the flow of charged particles, such as ions, across the cell membrane. It is the movement of these charged particles that generates electrical signals and allows for communication within and between cells. Current is influenced by the potential difference across the membrane and the conductance of the membrane to ions. Capacitance refers to the ability of the cell membrane to store electrical charge. The cell membrane acts as a capacitor, capable of storing and releasing electrical energy. Capacitance is important for the rapid changes in voltage that occur during action potentials and other electrical events in excitable cells.
###### **PART 2**
The membrane separates and stores charge through the selective permeability of its lipid bilayer and the presence of ion channels and pumps. The lipid bilayer of the cell membrane is composed of hydrophobic fatty acid tails that create a barrier to the movement of charged particles. This separation of charges allows for the establishment of a potential difference across the membrane. Ion channels, such as sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) channels, are integral membrane proteins that span the lipid bilayer. These channels selectively allow the passage of specific ions across the membrane, based on their size, charge, and other properties. This selective permeability contributes to the separation and storage of charges. Ion pumps, such as the sodium-potassium ATPase pump, actively transport ions across the membrane, creating and maintaining concentration gradients. This active transport requires energy in the form of ATP and helps to establish and regulate the distribution of charges across the membrane.

Na+ and K+ ion channels play a crucial role in generating the membrane potential (MP) by allowing the selective movement of ions across the cell membrane. Sodium (Na+) channels permit the rapid influx of sodium into the cell upon opening, resulting in depolarization (more positive). This depolarization contributes to the generation of action potentials and the propagation of electrical signals in excitable cells. Potassium (K+) channels, on the other hand, permit the rapid efflux of potassium out of the cell upon opening, resulting in hyperpolarization (more negative). This hyperpolarization helps to restore the resting membrane potential after an action potential and contributes to the repolarization phase of the action potential. The opening and closing of these ion channels are regulated by changes in the membrane potential. For example, voltage-gated sodium channels open in response to depolarization, while voltage-gated potassium channels open in response to repolarization. The selective permeability of the membrane to Na+ and K+ ions, mediated by these ion channels, contributes to the establishment and maintenance of the membrane potential, which is essential for various cellular processes, including the transmission of electrical signals in neurons.

The significance of the differential permeability of the membrane to Na+ and K+ lies in its contribution to the establishment and maintenance of the resting membrane potential and the generation of action potentials. The membrane is more permeable to K+ ions compared to Na+ ions. This differential permeability allows K+ ions to move more freely across the membrane, leading to a net efflux of K+ ions out of the cell. As a result, the inside of the cell becomes more negatively charged, establishing the resting membrane potential. During an action potential, the differential permeability of the membrane to Na+ and K+ ions plays a crucial role. When the membrane depolarizes, voltage-gated Na+ channels open, allowing a rapid influx of Na+ ions into the cell, leading to depolarization. This influx of positive charge contributes to the rising phase of the action potential. Following depolarization, voltage-gated K+ channels open, allowing a rapid efflux of K+ ions out of the cell. This efflux of positive charge contributes to the repolarization phase of the action potential. The differential permeability of the membrane to Na+ and K+ ions is essential for the generation and propagation of action potentials, as it allows for the rapid changes in membrane potential required for electrical signaling in excitable cells.
###### **PART 3**
The AP is triggered when the membrane potential reaches a specific threshold level of depolarization. This threshold is necessary to activate voltage-gated sodium channels and initiate the rapid depolarization phase of the AP. The AP is an all-or-nothing event, meaning that once the threshold is reached, the AP is generated and propagates along the axon without decrement. The magnitude and duration of the AP are consistent regardless of the strength of the stimulus that triggered it. The AP propagates along the axon in a self-regenerating manner. As the depolarization spreads, it triggers the opening of voltage-gated sodium channels in adjacent regions of the membrane, leading to the generation of new APs. This allows the AP to travel rapidly and efficiently along the length of the axon. After an AP, the membrane enters refractory periods during which it is temporarily inexcitable. The refractory periods include an absolute refractory period, during which no new AP can be generated, and a relative refractory period, during which a stronger stimulus is required to generate a new AP. Following depolarization, the membrane undergoes repolarization, during which the membrane potential returns to its resting state. This repolarization is primarily driven by the opening of voltage-gated potassium channels, allowing the efflux of potassium ions. After repolarization, the membrane potential briefly hyperpolarizes, becoming more negative than the resting membrane potential. This after-hyperpolarization is caused by the prolonged opening of potassium channels, leading to an excessive efflux of potassium ions.

The resting membrane potential is typically around -70 mV. At this stage, the membrane is polarized, with a higher concentration of negatively charged ions inside the cell compared to the outside. When a depolarizing stimulus reaches the threshold, voltage-gated sodium (Na+) channels open, allowing an influx of Na+ ions into the cell. This rapid influx of positive charge causes the membrane potential to become more positive, leading to depolarization. As more Na+ ions enter the cell, the membrane potential continues to rise rapidly, reaching a peak around +30 mV. This phase is characterized by a high conductance of Na+ ions. After reaching its peak, the membrane potential starts to repolarize. Voltage-gated sodium channels become inactivated, and voltage-gated potassium (K+) channels open, allowing the efflux of K+ ions. This efflux of positive charge leads to the repolarization of the membrane potential. As K+ ions continue to leave the cell, the membrane potential decreases, returning to its resting state. This phase is characterized by a high conductance of K+ ions. Following repolarization, the membrane potential briefly hyperpolarizes, becoming more negative than the resting membrane potential. This is caused by the prolonged opening of K+ channels, leading to an excessive efflux of K+ ions.

Threshold refers to the minimum level of depolarization that must be reached in order to trigger an action potential. It is the point at which the voltage-gated sodium channels open, allowing an influx of sodium ions and initiating the rapid depolarization phase of the action potential. Refractory periods are periods of time during which the membrane is temporarily inexcitable and cannot generate another action potential. There are two types of refractory periods: absolute refractory period and relative refractory period. The absolute refractory period immediately follows the initiation of an action potential during which the membrane is completely unresponsive to any stimulus. It occurs due to the inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels and lasts until the resting membrane potential is restored. The relative refractory period is the period following the absolute refractory period during which the membrane can be stimulated to generate another action potential, but only with a stronger-than-normal stimulus. It occurs due to the hyperpolarization phase of the action potential, which makes it more difficult to reach the threshold for generating another action potential.

The action potential (AP) is conducted along the axon of a neuron through a process called saltatory conduction. This process involves the rapid propagation of the AP from one node of Ranvier to the next, skipping the myelinated regions of the axon. The importance of myelin in AP conduction lies in its ability to increase the speed and efficiency of signal transmission. Myelin is a fatty substance that wraps around the axon, forming a protective sheath. It acts as an insulator, preventing the leakage of ions and reducing the capacitance of the membrane. The myelin sheath is interrupted at regular intervals by small gaps called nodes of Ranvier. These nodes contain a high density of voltage-gated sodium channels, which are responsible for the rapid depolarization and initiation of the AP. When the AP reaches a node of Ranvier, it rapidly depolarizes the membrane, triggering the opening of sodium channels and the generation of a new AP. The myelin sheath allows the AP to "jump" from one node of Ranvier to the next, a process known as saltatory conduction. This significantly increases the speed of signal transmission compared to continuous conduction along unmyelinated axons. The myelin sheath acts as an insulator, preventing the dissipation of the electrical signal and allowing it to travel faster and more efficiently. Saltatory conduction is particularly important in long axons, where the speed of signal transmission is crucial for rapid communication between different parts of the nervous system. It allows for efficient and rapid transmission of electrical signals, enabling precise and coordinated responses in the body.

###### **PART 1**
The structure of muscle cells includes various components such as the Z disk, A-band (thick myosin filaments), M-line, sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), transverse tubule, terminal cisterns, triad, sarcolemma, mitochondrion, I-band, A-band, myofibrils, dyad, and striated muscle  Skeletal muscle cells are unbranched and are organized in a parallel manner, forming long, cylindrical, multinucleated fibers. These fibers are arranged in bundles and are surrounded by connective tissue. The myofibrils within skeletal muscle cells are aligned in a parallel manner, giving rise to the characteristic striated appearance  In contrast, cardiac muscle cells, or cardiomyocytes, are branched and interconnected, forming a network through intercalated discs. These discs contain gap junctions, which allow for the rapid conduction of electrical impulses between cells, and desmosomes, which provide mechanical strength to the tissue. The branching nature of cardiac fibers allows for the synchronization of contraction and the efficient propagation of electrical signals throughout the heart. 

Ventricular myocytes, the predominant type of cardiac muscle cells in the heart, are brick-shaped and fit together like bricks in a wall to form a syncytium. This arrangement allows for coordinated contraction and relaxation, essential for the pumping function of the heart  The intercalated disks in cardiac muscle play a crucial role in facilitating the synchronization of electrical impulses between adjacent cells. These specialized structures contain gap junctions, which allow for the rapid conduction of electrical signals between cells, and connexons, which are the hemi-channels that form low-resistance pathways coupling adjacent cells  The connexons, made of six proteins called connexins, are present in each cell and facilitate the movement of ions, electrons, and small molecules between cells, enabling the spread of excitation across and along the ventricular wall.

Cardiac muscle excitability is influenced by ion permeability and movement. The Nernst equation, which describes the equilibrium potential for a specific ion based on its concentration gradient, is fundamental in understanding ion movement in cardiac muscle  The cardiac action potential, which is characterized by a long duration (200-400ms), involves the movement of ions across the cell membrane, leading to changes in membrane potential and the generation of electrical impulses  The cardiac action potential is regulated by the movement of ions such as calcium, sodium, and potassium across the cell membrane. This movement is essential for the generation and propagation of electrical signals in cardiac muscle, ultimately leading to the contraction and relaxation of the heart. 

The spread of excitation across and along the ventricular wall in the heart is influenced by several factors. The complex fiber orientation in the ventricle, with varying orientations of cardiac muscle fibers, affects the spread of excitation  Additionally, the presence of connexons at the ends of cardiac cells, forming gap junctions, facilitates anisotropic conduction, allowing for the rapid spread of electrical signals in specific directions  The concentration gradients of ions, such as potassium (K+) and sodium (Na+), also play a role in influencing the spread of excitation across the ventricular wall  During systole, the electrical properties of cardiac muscle are characterized by the depolarization of the cell membrane, leading to the contraction of the myocardium. In contrast, during diastole, the cell membrane repolarizes, and the muscle relaxes  The duration of the cardiac action potential, which ranges from 200 to 400 milliseconds, is a key feature of the electrical properties of cardiac muscle. 

The action potentials of skeletal and cardiac muscle differ in duration, with the cardiac action potential being significantly longer. This difference is primarily due to the presence of a plateau phase in the cardiac action potential, which prolongs its duration compared to the action potential in skeletal muscle  The plateau phase is attributed to the prolonged opening of L-type calcium channels and the slow influx of calcium ions, which contributes to the extended duration of the cardiac action potential.

###### **PART 2**
Excitation-contraction coupling refers to the process by which electrical excitation triggers mechanical contraction in muscle cells. This process involves the role of calcium in transitioning from the wave of excitation to the wave of contraction. In cardiac muscle, the action potential triggers an intracellular calcium transient, leading to contraction. This process involves the interplay of various components such as the dyadic cleft, ryanodine receptor (RyR), L-type calcium channel, and the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Similarly, in skeletal muscle, voltage-induced calcium release is a key mechanism in excitation-contraction coupling, activating the proteins involved in muscle contraction such as actin, tropomyosin, myosin, and troponin. Furthermore, the relaxation phase in excitation-contraction coupling involves the coordinated action of various channels and proteins, including the sodium-calcium exchanger, phospholamban, and the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA).

The cardiac action potential is a crucial component of excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac muscle. It is characterized by a long duration, typically ranging from 200 to 400 milliseconds, depending on the species and heart rate. This extended duration is essential for preventing tetany and protecting against re-entrant arrhythmias. The role of calcium in triggering intracellular calcium transients and subsequent contraction is central to excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac muscle. The action potential triggers an intracellular calcium transient, leading to contraction. This process involves the interplay of various components, including the dyadic cleft, ryanodine receptor (RyR), L-type calcium channels, and the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The dyadic cleft serves as the site of interaction between the L-type calcium channels and the RyR, facilitating the release of calcium from the SR into the cytoplasm. The L-type calcium channels allow the influx of extracellular calcium, which triggers the opening of RyR and the release of calcium from the SR. This increase in intracellular calcium concentration then leads to the activation of the contractile proteins, ultimately resulting in muscle contraction.

Cardiac and skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling mechanisms exhibit distinct differences in their regulation and signaling pathways. In skeletal muscle, excitation-contraction coupling is primarily driven by voltage-induced calcium release. Upon depolarization of the T-tubule membrane, the voltage-gated L-type calcium channels open, leading to an influx of extracellular calcium into the cytoplasm, which triggers the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) through the ryanodine receptor (RyR). This process activates the contractile proteins, ultimately resulting in muscle contraction.

In contrast, excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac muscle involves calcium-induced calcium release. The action potential triggers an intracellular calcium transient, leading to contraction. This process involves the interplay of various components, including the dyadic cleft, RyR, L-type calcium channels, and the SR. The dyadic cleft serves as the site of interaction between the L-type calcium channels and the RyR, facilitating the release of calcium from the SR into the cytoplasm. The increase in intracellular calcium concentration then leads to the activation of the contractile proteins, ultimately resulting in muscle contraction. In cardiac muscle, the triadic cleft is a specialized structure consisting of the T-tubule, the SR, and the dyadic space. This arrangement allows for close apposition between the L-type calcium channels on the T-tubule and the RyR on the SR, facilitating efficient calcium-induced calcium release and excitation-contraction coupling.

In skeletal muscle, the mechanism by which calcium activates contraction involves the inter-relationship between myofilament proteins, including actin, tropomyosin, troponin, and myosin. When calcium is released from intracellular stores through voltage-induced calcium release, it binds to troponin C, causing a conformational change that pulls tropomyosin away from the myosin-binding sites on actin. This exposure of the myosin-binding sites allows myosin to bind to actin, forming cross-bridges and initiating the power-stroke of cross-bridge formation. This process is driven by the energy provided by ATP, allowing the myosin head to release from actin and swing forward, resulting in muscle contraction. The inter-relationship between these myofilament proteins is crucial for the regulation of muscle contraction. Troponin, tropomyosin, actin, and myosin work together to regulate the interaction between actin and myosin, ultimately controlling the contraction and relaxation of skeletal muscle fibers. This intricate interplay between the myofilament proteins is essential for the proper functioning of skeletal muscle contraction.

In both skeletal and cardiac muscle, tension is regulated through the interaction of myofilament proteins and the concentration of calcium. In skeletal muscle, the binding of calcium to troponin C leads to a conformational change that allows myosin to bind to actin, forming cross-bridges and initiating muscle contraction. The regulation of tension in skeletal muscle is primarily achieved through the control of cross-bridge formation and the overlap of myofilaments. In cardiac muscle, tension regulation is more graded compared to skeletal muscle. The more calcium present, the more cross-bridges are formed, leading to increased tension in a graded manner. This graded nature of contraction in cardiac muscle allows for fine-tuning of contractile force in response to varying calcium levels, which is crucial for the precise control of cardiac output. The regulation of tension in cardiac muscle is also influenced by the size of the intracellular calcium transient and the diastolic length of the muscle. These factors contribute to the graded nature of contraction in cardiac muscle, allowing for the adjustment of contractile force based on the physiological demands of the heart.

###### **PART 3**
The myofilament calcium-tension relationship describes the correlation between the concentration of calcium ions and the resulting tension in muscle contraction. As the concentration of calcium increases, the tension generated by the muscle also increases. This relationship is typically depicted in a graph showing tension (% of max) against the negative logarithm of calcium concentration (pCa). The graph demonstrates a sigmoidal curve, indicating that as calcium concentration rises, tension increases until it reaches a maximum level. Factors altering calcium sensitivity, such as temperature, pH, intracellular inorganic phosphate (Pi), and drugs, can modulate the myofilament calcium-tension relationship. For instance, an increase in temperature can enhance calcium sensitivity, leading to greater tension generation. Changes in pH, particularly acidosis, can reduce calcium sensitivity and diminish tension. Intracellular inorganic phosphate (Pi) can also impact calcium sensitivity, with elevated levels potentially decreasing the sensitivity of the myofilaments to calcium. Additionally, certain drugs, such as inotropic agents, can alter calcium sensitivity and affect muscle contraction. 

Ischaemia, or inadequate blood supply to the myocardium, has profound effects on myocardial function. In an isolated rat heart, the timeline of left ventricular pressure during ischaemia shows a rapid decline in pressure as the blood supply is compromised. During ischaemia, the myocardium experiences contractile failure due to the depletion of high-energy phosphates, such as creatine phosphate, which are essential for sustaining contractile function. Cellular changes occur, including the accumulation of intracellular calcium, the production of reactive oxygen species, and the activation of proteolytic enzymes, leading to cellular damage. The heart becomes a 'permissive' pump, meaning that it adapts to maintain circulation despite compromised function. This adaptation involves a shift in energy metabolism and alterations in contractile protein function to sustain cardiac output under ischemic conditions. 

The length-tension relationship in both skeletal and cardiac muscle is crucial for understanding muscle contraction. In skeletal muscle, the length-tension relationship is influenced by the overlap of myofilaments within the sarcomere. As the sarcomere length changes, the degree of myofilament overlap affects the tension generated during muscle contraction. Similarly, in cardiac muscle, the length-tension relationship is influenced by myofilament overlap, which is essential for the generation of tension during contraction  The increased Ca2+ affinity of muscle filaments plays a significant role in the length-tension relationship. This increased affinity allows for a greater sensitivity of the muscle filaments to Ca2+, leading to enhanced cross-bridge formation and increased tension generation. The regulation of Ca2+ affinity is crucial for modulating the contractile function of both skeletal and cardiac muscle, ensuring efficient muscle contraction in response to varying physiological demands.

The force-frequency relationship demonstrates how force varies with the frequency of stimulation. As the frequency of stimulation increases, the force of contraction also increases. This relationship is often depicted in a graph showing force (% of maximum) against the frequency of stimulation (Hz). The "staircase effect" or Treppe, discovered by Henry Bowditch in 1871, describes the phenomenon where the force of contraction increases with each successive stimulation at a low frequency, resulting in a stepwise increase in tension.

In human hearts, the force-frequency relationship impacts tension with different frequencies of stimulation. At higher frequencies of stimulation, the force of contraction increases, leading to greater tension generation. This relationship is crucial for understanding the response of the heart to varying levels of stimulation and its ability to modulate contractile force based on the demands placed upon it. When comparing non-failing and failing hearts, differences in the force-frequency relationship can be observed. Failing hearts may exhibit altered responses to changes in stimulation frequency, leading to impaired force generation compared to non-failing hearts. This difference highlights the impact of cardiac dysfunction on the force-frequency relationship and its implications for cardiac performance.

###### **PART 1**
Body fluid compartments refer to the different spaces in the body where fluids are distributed. The distribution of body fluids is as follows: Intracellular space (ICS) is the fluid compartment within the cells, which accounts for approximately 40% of body weight. Interstitial space is the fluid compartment between the cells and the blood vessels, which accounts for approximately 15% of body weight. Plasma space is the fluid compartment within the blood vessels, specifically the plasma, which accounts for approximately 5% of body weight.  Other fluid compartments are spaces that are part of the extracellular space (ECS) but may have slow diffusion to and from plasma. Examples include cerebrospinal fluid, aqueous and vitreous humors of the eye, synovial fluid, amniotic fluid, GI tract secretions, and lymph.

Total body water (TBW) refers to the total amount of water present in the body. It is composed of both intracellular fluid (ICF) and extracellular fluid (ECF). ICF is the fluid compartment within the cells and accounts for approximately 40% of body weight. It is composed of water and various solutes, including ions (such as sodium, potassium, and calcium), proteins, and metabolites. ECF is the fluid compartment outside the cells and is further divided into interstitial fluid and plasma. Interstitial fluid is the fluid that surrounds the cells and accounts for approximately 15% of body weight. It contains water, ions, nutrients, waste products, and other solutes that are exchanged between the cells and the blood vessels. Plasma is the fluid component of blood and accounts for approximately 5% of body weight. It contains water, ions, proteins (such as albumin, globulins, and fibrinogen), and other solutes that are involved in various physiological processes, including transport, buffering of pH, and immune response. 

Transcellular fluids refer to the fluid compartments that are considered part of the extracellular space (ECS) but have limited diffusion to and from plasma. These fluids are found in various spaces within the body and include: Cerebrospinal fluid surrounds the brain and spinal cord, offering cushioning and support for the central nervous system. Aqueous and vitreous humors maintain eye shape and pressure, supplying nutrients to eye tissues. Synovial fluid in joints lubricates and reduces friction, enabling smooth movement. Amniotic fluid protects and cushions the developing fetus during pregnancy. GI tract secretions aid in digestion, nutrient absorption, and waste elimination. Lymph circulates in the lymphatic system, supporting the immune response and fluid balance.

The dilution method is used to measure fluid compartments by adding a known amount of a substance (S) to an unknown volume (V) and then measuring the resulting concentration (C). The formula used is C = S/V, which can be rearranged to solve for V: V = S/C. For example, to measure the volume of a fluid compartment, a known amount of a substance (such as a dye or tracer) is added to the compartment. The concentration of the substance is then measured, and by using the formula V = S/C, the volume of the compartment can be calculated.

Substances that can be used to measure fluid compartments should meet certain criteria, including being non-toxic, not metabolized quickly, and distributing in the space of interest. Some examples of substances that meet these criteria include: Plasma volume substances that do not cross capillaries easily and have a large size, such as Evans Blue, labeled Inulin, or Albumin. Extracellular space (ECS): Substances that do not enter cells easily, such as 24Na or Sucrose. Total body water (TBW): Substances that distribute with all water, such as 3H (tritium).
###### **PART 2**
The composition of body and cellular fluids varies across different compartments. In plasma, the major ions include Sodium (Na+), Potassium (K+), Calcium (Ca2+), Magnesium (Mg2+), Chloride (Cl-), Bicarbonate (HCO3-), and Phosphate (PO42-). Additionally, plasma contains various constituents like proteins (such as albumin, globulins, and fibrinogen), glucose, lipids, hormones, and enzymes. Interstitial fluid shares a similar ionic composition with plasma, including Sodium, Potassium, Calcium, Magnesium, Chloride, Bicarbonate, and Phosphate, along with constituents like nutrients, waste products, gases, hormones, and enzymes. In contrast, intracellular fluid primarily consists of Potassium, Sodium, Magnesium, Phosphate, and Sulfate ions, and its other constituents encompass proteins, nucleic acids, glucose, lipids, and various metabolites. 

Osmotic pressure is the force exerted by solute particles in a solution, governing the movement of water through a semipermeable membrane. Osmolality refers to the concentration of osmotically active particles per kilogram of solvent, while osmolarity denotes the concentration of osmotically active particles per liter of solution. In plasma, the osmolarity measures approximately 290 mosmol/L, a critical parameter as even a 1% variance in osmolarity between extracellular and intracellular fluid compartments can generate over 50 mmHg of pressure across the cell membrane. The primary contributors to osmolarity in plasma are sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), and bicarbonate (HCO3-), with concentrations of approximately 140 mmol/L for sodium and chloride. Osmotic pressures are also influenced by plasma proteins, notably albumin, which contributes to the oncotic (colloidal osmotic) pressure. The oncotic pressure exerted by plasma proteins is roughly 25 mmHg. This intricate interplay of osmotic forces is vital for maintaining fluid balance and cellular integrity.

Crystalloid osmotic pressure refers to the pressure generated by small, easily diffusible ions like sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), and potassium (K+) present in body fluids. These ions can readily traverse capillary walls and contribute to the osmotic pressure gradient between various fluid compartments. In contrast, oncotic osmotic pressure, also known as colloidal osmotic pressure, primarily arises from the presence of plasma proteins, particularly albumin. These proteins are too large to pass through capillary walls easily and predominantly reside within the plasma compartment. The oncotic pressure established by these proteins plays a crucial role in balancing hydrostatic pressure and regulating the movement of fluids and solutes across capillaries. Both crystalloid and oncotic osmotic pressures collaborate to uphold fluid equilibrium and govern the transfer of water and solutes among different fluid compartments in the body, ensuring the delicate balance of bodily fluids.

Hydrostatic pressure and oncotic pressure are opposing forces pivotal in orchestrating fluid movement across capillary walls. Hydrostatic pressure signifies the pressure exerted by the fluid within the capillaries, primarily influenced by the heart's pumping action and the resistance encountered in blood vessels. Its action propels fluid out of capillaries into the interstitial space. In contrast, oncotic pressure, also termed colloidal osmotic pressure, results predominantly from plasma proteins, notably albumin, which are too large to cross capillary walls easily. These proteins predominantly remain in the plasma compartment, and the oncotic pressure they generate helps counterbalance hydrostatic pressure, directing fluid movement back into the capillaries from the interstitial space.

Ionic composition pertains to the concentrations of different ions in body fluids, encompassing sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), chloride (Cl-), bicarbonate (HCO3-), and phosphate (PO42-). These ions play pivotal roles in upholding fluid equilibrium, regulating cellular activities, and facilitating diverse physiological processes. Plasma proteins constitute a diverse array of proteins located in the plasma component of blood, including albumin, globulins, fibrinogen, and others. These proteins fulfill various functions, such as preserving osmotic pressure, facilitating the transport of substances like hormones and lipids, bolstering immune responses, and contributing to the blood clotting process.

###### **PART 3**
Haematopoiesis, the process of forming new blood cells, occurs within the bone marrow. This intricate process involves the differentiation and maturation of hematopoietic stem cells into various blood cell types, encompassing red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The journey commences with the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells located in the bone marrow. These remarkable stem cells possess the capacity for self-renewal and the potential to generate diverse blood cell types. Guided by a medley of growth factors and cytokines, these stem cells take on the identity of either myeloid or lymphoid progenitor cells.

Myeloid progenitor cells further transform into erythrocytes (red blood cells), granulocytes (comprising neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils), monocytes, and platelets. Meanwhile, lymphoid progenitor cells specialize into lymphocytes, integral components of the immune system. The orchestration of haematopoiesis is meticulously regulated to maintain equilibrium between the production and depletion of blood cells. This process responds to an array of factors, including hormonal signals, growth factors, and the body's demand for various blood cell types. Such fine-tuned control ensures the body's vital blood cell populations are optimally managed.

Erythrocytes, commonly known as red blood cells, represent the predominant cell type within the bloodstream. Their chief responsibility is the transportation of oxygen from the lungs to body tissues and the removal of carbon dioxide from tissues, ultimately transporting it back to the lungs for exhalation. Notably, erythrocytes possess a distinctive feature: they lack a nucleus and other organelles, a design that maximizes space for accommodating the crucial oxygen-binding molecule known as hemoglobin. Hemoglobin's role is to bind with oxygen in the lungs and subsequently release it within the body's tissues, thereby facilitating the essential exchange of gases. In terms of their concentration in the blood, the typical count of erythrocytes stands at approximately 5.5 x 10^12 per liter for males and 4.8 x 10^12 per liter for females. This balance is fundamental to sustaining effective oxygen transport within the circulatory system.

Leucocytes, commonly referred to as white blood cells, are a vital component of the immune system, playing a critical role in defending the body against foreign invaders, participating in inflammatory and allergic responses, and contributing to the production of immunoglobulins. White blood cells come in various types, which include granulocytes like neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils, as well as monocytes and lymphocytes. Neutrophils are primarily responsible for chemotaxis and phagocytosis, eosinophils play a role in phagocytosis and allergic responses, and basophils release substances like histamine and heparin. Typically, the total white blood cell count in the blood ranges from approximately 4 to 11 x 10^9 per liter. This diverse group of cells collectively forms a crucial part of the body's defense mechanisms.

Platelets, also known as thrombocytes, are minute, disc-shaped cell fragments with a crucial role in hemostasis, the intricate process of blood clot formation. These platelets originate from megakaryocytes situated in the bone marrow. Their primary function is to participate in the creation of blood clots, preventing excessive bleeding. Upon an injury to a blood vessel, platelets adhere to the damaged site and gather together, forming a plug to seal the wound. Furthermore, they release a variety of substances, including clotting factors and growth factors, which enhance clot development and facilitate the healing of injuries. Normally, the concentration of platelets in the blood falls within the range of approximately 150 to 400 x 10^9 per liter. Platelets play a vital role in maintaining the body's hemostatic balance.

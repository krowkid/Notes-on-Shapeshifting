###### **PART 1**
The sympathetic nervous system generally triggers excitement, causing pupil dilation, increased heart rate, and adrenaline release, part of the "fight or flight" response. Conversely, the parasympathetic system typically inhibits, leading to pupil constriction, reduced heart rate, and a "rest and digest" mode. These systems, governed by the autonomic nervous system, control various bodily functions except for skeletal muscle control.

Cholinergic signal transmission differs from adrenergic signal transmission in several ways. Cholinergic signal transmission involves the release of acetylcholine as the primary neurotransmitter, which acts on cholinergic receptors such as nicotinic and muscarinic receptors. These receptors are found at autonomic ganglia, the neuromuscular junction, and the central nervous system, and their activation leads to excitatory or inhibitory signaling. In contrast, adrenergic signal transmission involves the release of norepinephrine (noradrenaline) as the main neurotransmitter, which acts on adrenergic receptors such as alpha and beta receptors. These receptors are found at target tissues and mediate responses such as vasoconstriction, increased heart rate, and bronchodilator. Furthermore, cholinergic signal transmission is often associated with the parasympathetic nervous system, which generally results in inhibitory responses, while adrenergic signal transmission is associated with the sympathetic nervous system, which usually results in excitatory responses.

A range of drugs effectively modulate the autonomic nervous system for diverse therapeutic purposes. For instance, Clonidine, an alpha2 agonist, manages hypertension, while Adrenaline, an adrenergic receptor agonist, aids in heart restarting and anaphylaxis treatment. Salbutamol, a beta2 agonist, targets asthma, and Mirabegron, acting on beta3 receptors, tackles overactive bladder. Prazosin, an alpha1 antagonist, also treats hypertension. Neostigmine, an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor, serves clinical uses. These medications directly influence adrenoceptors or hinder acetylcholine breakdown, enabling control over blood pressure, asthma, and overactive bladder, among other conditions.

Parasympathetic signaling involves the release of acetylcholine (ACh) as the primary neurotransmitter, which acts on cholinergic receptors. These receptors are found in various target tissues, including the heart, bronchi, stomach, and bladder, among others. Activation of these receptors leads to specific physiological effects, such as pupil constriction, increased motility in the digestive system, and relaxation of the bladder and genitalia. At the cholinergic synapse, the modulation of signal transduction involves several steps. These include the synthesis of acetylcholine from choline and acetyl-CoA, the storage of acetylcholine in vesicles, its release into the synaptic cleft, binding to cholinergic receptors, reuptake, and degradation. Modulation of cholinergic signal transduction can occur at any of these steps, affecting the overall cholinergic neurotransmission. For example, drugs such as neostigmine act as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, preventing the degradation of acetylcholine and thereby prolonging its action at the synapse. This modulation increases the availability of acetylcholine, leading to enhanced cholinergic signaling and physiological effects.
###### **PART 2**
The sympathetic neuroeffector junction is the site where sympathetic nerve fibers release neurotransmitters to act on target tissues, such as smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, and glands. At this junction, the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) is released from sympathetic nerve terminals and binds to adrenergic receptors on the target tissue. This binding leads to various physiological responses, such as vasoconstriction, increased heart rate, and bronchodilator. Modulation of sympathetic signal transduction can occur at different levels. For example, the synthesis and release of norepinephrine can be modulated by factors such as neuronal firing rate and the availability of precursor molecules. Additionally, the activity of adrenergic receptors on target tissues can be modulated, affecting the responsiveness of the tissue to norepinephrine. Furthermore, the reuptake and degradation of norepinephrine can also be modulated, influencing the duration and intensity of sympathetic neurotransmission.

The SNS and PNS nervous systems collaborate in baroreflex for blood pressure regulation. Increased blood pressure stretches arterial walls, activating nerve endings that signal the NTS. The NTS compares this signal to a set point, prompting actions like boosting parasympathetic activity to the heart, reducing heart rate and cardiac output. Simultaneously, it diminishes sympathetic drive to the heart, arteries, and veins, lowering heart rate, contraction force, and arterial constriction, thus reducing total peripheral resistance. This orchestrated response aims to bring blood pressure back to the set point. If blood pressure drops, opposite actions are triggered to restore it to the desired level.

They collaborate in regulating micturition. When the bladder fills, it triggers contraction via the PNS receptors M2 and M3. During micturition, the bladder relaxes due to the activation of the b3 receptors under the SNS. The urethra contracts through the SNS's a1 receptors and relaxes via PNS action. Nitric oxide release causes relaxation in the PNS, while somatic input turns off the external urethral sphincter, enabling urination.

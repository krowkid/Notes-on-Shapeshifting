# Passage

Electrical transmission, such as in the heart, involves the direct flow of electrical signals between cells through gap junctions. These gap junctions allow ions to pass freely from one cell to another, resulting in rapid and synchronized communication. This type of transmission is fast and does not require the release of chemical messengers. On the other hand, chemical transmission, such as in neural synapses, involves the release of neurotransmitters from the presynaptic neuron into the synaptic cleft. These neurotransmitters then bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, initiating a series of biochemical events that lead to the generation of an electrical signal. This type of transmission is slower compared to electrical transmission but allows for more complex and modifiable communication between neurons.

The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a specialized synapse between a motor neuron and a muscle fiber. It plays a crucial role in synaptic transmission by allowing the motor neuron to communicate with the muscle fiber and initiate muscle contraction. When an action potential reaches the presynaptic terminal of the motor neuron, voltage-gated calcium channels open, leading to an influx of calcium ions into the terminal. This increase in calcium concentration triggers the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane, releasing acetylcholine (ACh) into the synaptic cleft. ACh diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on the postsynaptic membrane of the muscle fiber. This binding causes the opening of ion channels, allowing the influx of sodium ions and the efflux of potassium ions, resulting in depolarization of the muscle fiber. The depolarization of the muscle fiber leads to the generation of an action potential, which propagates along the muscle fiber and triggers muscle contraction.

The main structural features of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) include the presynaptic terminal of the motor neuron, the synaptic cleft, and the postsynaptic membrane of the muscle fiber. The presynaptic terminal is the end of the motor neuron that forms specialized structures called synaptic boutons or end plates. These boutons contain numerous synaptic vesicles filled with neurotransmitters, specifically acetylcholine (ACh) in the case of the NMJ. The synaptic cleft is the narrow gap between the presynaptic terminal and the postsynaptic membrane. It acts as a physical barrier that separates the two cells and allows for the diffusion of neurotransmitters. The postsynaptic membrane of the muscle fiber contains specialized receptors called nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). These receptors are located at high density in the region of the muscle fiber known as the motor end plate. They bind to ACh released from the presynaptic terminal and initiate the generation of an electrical signal in the muscle fiber.

The mechanism of quantal release of transmitters refers to the release of neurotransmitters from synaptic vesicles in discrete packets called quanta. Each quantum represents the minimum amount of neurotransmitter released in response to an action potential. When an action potential reaches the presynaptic terminal, voltage-gated calcium channels open, allowing calcium ions to enter the terminal. The increase in calcium concentration triggers the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane, resulting in the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. The release of neurotransmitters occurs in a probabilistic manner, meaning that not all synaptic vesicles release neurotransmitters with each action potential. Instead, the release is stochastic, with some vesicles releasing neurotransmitters while others do not. This stochastic release is due to the variability in the number of calcium channels opening and the sensitivity of individual vesicles to calcium. The quantal release of transmitters ensures that the synaptic transmission is reliable and can be finely regulated. By releasing neurotransmitters in discrete packets, the strength of the synaptic signal can be adjusted by modulating the number of quanta released.

The basis of miniature end plate potentials (MEPPs) and end plate potentials (EPPs) lies in the synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). MEPPs are small, spontaneous depolarizations that occur in the postsynaptic membrane of the muscle fiber even in the absence of presynaptic stimulation. They are caused by the release of individual quanta of acetylcholine (ACh) from a single synaptic vesicle. MEPPs are typically smaller in amplitude compared to EPPs and do not generate muscle contraction. EPPs, on the other hand, are large depolarizations of the postsynaptic membrane that occur in response to presynaptic stimulation at the NMJ. When an action potential reaches the presynaptic terminal, it triggers the release of a large number of ACh quanta simultaneously, leading to a synchronized and amplified depolarization of the muscle fiber. EPPs are responsible for initiating muscle contraction. The difference in amplitude between MEPPs and EPPs is due to the number of quanta released and the resulting summation of their effects on the postsynaptic membrane. MEPPs represent the spontaneous release of a single quantum, while EPPs result from the summation of multiple quanta released simultaneously.

Temporal and spatial summation are two mechanisms by which postsynaptic potentials, such as excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs), are integrated to determine whether a neuron will reach the threshold for firing an action potential. Temporal summation refers to the summation of postsynaptic potentials that occur in rapid succession from the same presynaptic neuron. When a presynaptic neuron repeatedly fires action potentials, the EPSPs or IPSPs generated by each action potential can add up over time, leading to a cumulative effect on the postsynaptic membrane potential. If the summation of these potentials reaches the threshold for firing an action potential, it will be triggered. Spatial summation, on the other hand, involves the summation of postsynaptic potentials that are generated simultaneously by different presynaptic neurons. When multiple presynaptic neurons release neurotransmitters onto the same postsynaptic neuron, the EPSPs and IPSPs generated by each neuron can summate spatially at the postsynaptic membrane. If the combined effect of these potentials reaches the threshold for firing an action potential, it will be triggered.

A subthreshold postsynaptic response refers to a change in the membrane potential of a postsynaptic neuron that does not reach the threshold for generating an action potential. It can be either an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) or an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP). Graded potentials are changes in the membrane potential of a neuron that vary in amplitude and do not propagate along the length of the neuron. They can be either depolarizing (excitatory) or hyperpolarizing (inhibitory) and are generated by the summation of EPSPs and IPSPs. A suprathreshold postsynaptic response refers to a change in the membrane potential of a postsynaptic neuron that reaches or exceeds the threshold for generating an action potential. It is typically generated by the summation of EPSPs that depolarize the neuron to a level where an action potential is triggered. 

Bernard Katz discovered that the release of neurotransmitters from synaptic vesicles is a quantal process, meaning that neurotransmitters are released in discrete packets called quanta. Reduced vesicle release refers to a decrease in the number of quanta released, which can be caused by factors such as low calcium levels, high magnesium levels, or the presence of certain drugs like curare.

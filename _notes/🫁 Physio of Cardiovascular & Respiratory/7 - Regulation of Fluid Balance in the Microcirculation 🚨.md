The microcirculation encompasses the terminal arterioles, capillaries, and post-capillary venules. It serves as the site for the exchange of gases, water, nutrients, and waste materials between the blood and body tissues, occurring via the interstitial compartment. This intricate network consists of blood vessels with diameters ranging from 3 to 10 microns. Within this system, small arterioles, controlled by local factors and smooth muscle, regulate blood flow through a series of capillaries. Terminal arterioles lead to capillaries and post-capillary venules, acting as the primary exchange points. Capillaries and post-capillary venules lack smooth muscle and function primarily as exchange vessels. Additionally, lymphatic capillaries collect fluid and protein, returning them to the blood, and transport microorganisms to lymph glands. Post-capillary venules complete this microcirculatory pathway.

Continuous capillaries, found in most tissues, feature an endothelial monolayer covering the entire capillary surface, tightly joined by junctions. They represent the least permeable capillary type. Fenestrated capillaries, located in organs like the kidneys, joints, and intestinal mucosa, contain pores (fenestrae) within endothelial cells, making them approximately ten times more permeable to small hydrophilic molecules compared to continuous capillaries. Sinusoidal (discontinuous) capillaries, present in the liver, bone marrow, and spleen, have spaces between endothelial cells that readily allow large molecules, especially proteins, to diffuse across the capillary wall.

Various substances permeate the capillary wall through distinct pathways. The glycocalyx and tight spaces between endothelial cells form a barrier, influenced by the size of the molecules. Water primarily moves across via intercellular clefts (paracellular route). A glycoprotein layer covers the endothelium's inner surface, while the interstitium, transcellular, trans-route, vesicular, and wider intercellular gaps (during acute inflammation) also contribute to endothelial transport. Different molecules, such as proteins and lipids, follow specific routes, such as the paracellular route for smaller lipophobic molecules and the fenestral route for larger proteins. Concentration gradient and Fick's First Law guide the diffusion process based on the diffusion constant, area, and distance.

Approximately 4000 litres of plasma course through the capillaries daily, with a staggering 80,000 litres of fluid traversing the capillary walls in a bidirectional flow. The balance between filtration and absorption is nearly flawless, resulting in a meagre net volume of around 2 to 4 litres filtered daily across the entire microcirculation. This filtered fluid makes its way back to the bloodstream via the lymphatic system. When net filtration increases, either due to local or systemic factors, or if the lymphatic system faces obstruction, fluid accumulation transpires within tissues, a condition known as oedema.

The regulation of fluid filtration in the microcirculation involves the hydrostatic pressure gradient: Capillary pressure ranging from approximately 40 mmHg at the arteriolar end to about 15 mmHg at the venous end in open capillaries. Tissue Space pressure within the interstitium stands at around 0 mmHg (equivalent to atmospheric pressure). Hydrostatic Pressure gradient is the difference between capillary pressure (Pcap) and interstitial pressure (Pint), tends to propel water out of capillaries. It's worth noting that this explanation simplifies the effects of gravity, which alter hydrostatic pressure in the microcirculation below and above the heart—increasing pressure below and decreasing it above the heart.

The osmotic pressure gradient, caused by substances dissolved in a solution, drives water movement across a semi-permeable barrier. This pressure difference, determined by the reflection coefficient and permeability, influences water flow. Small molecules like electrolytes and glucose, with a reflection coefficient of 0, don't affect water distribution, while proteins, with a higher coefficient (~0.9), significantly impact water movement due to their low permeability. The oncotic pressure difference (~25-30 mmHg in plasma, 5-10 mmHg in interstitial fluid) drives water into capillaries.

The movement of fluid across exchange vessels is guided by the Starling equation, where the net fluid movement (J) is influenced by the pressure gradient (Pcap - Pint) and the reflection coefficient (σ). Generally, there's a slight outward pressure gradient throughout the body, leading to filtration slightly outweighing absorption, amounting to 2-4 litres per day. However, this gradient isn't fixed and can change locally; for instance, standing increases Pcap in lower limbs, temporarily elevating filtration. Reflexes promptly trigger arteriolar constriction in these areas, reducing Pcap to counteract the increased filtration.

Vasoconstriction affects net filtration significantly. In tissues with open feeder arterioles, capillaries are primarily in a relaxed state, promoting filtration. However, when arterioles contract, capillary hydrostatic pressure decreases, leading to a shift towards absorption becoming more relevant. Vasodilators, by reducing peripheral resistance, can cause oedema by altering pressures. In the kidneys, constant removal of proteins keeps their interstitial concentration low, creating a substantial osmotic gradient that favours reabsorption. As fluid is reabsorbed from the nephron, it dilutes interstitial proteins, aiding water movement back into the bloodstream. This mechanism mirrors a similar process in the intestinal mucosa. The low interstitial protein concentration increases the oncotic pressure gradient, promoting reabsorption. 

Factors influencing oedema formation involve the dynamics of net filtration, where oedema arises from filtration, absorption, and lymphatic flow imbalances. Oedema manifests when filtration surpasses the combined levels of absorption and lymphatic flow, triggered primarily by four factors: Elevated capillary hydrostatic pressure: Heart failure induces heightened venous pressure, impacting capillary dynamics. Venous obstruction, often due to thromboembolism, amplifies capillary pressure. Increased capillary or venular permeability: Inflammation exacerbates venular permeability, leading to the leakage of proteins into the interstitium. Reduced plasma oncotic pressure: Conditions such as malnutrition, burns, and liver dysfunction diminish plasma protein concentration. Lymphatic obstruction: Impediments in lymphatic flow, caused by factors like lymph node removal, lymphatic inflammation, or invasion by parasites, hinder the normal drainage process. 

The lymphatic system plays several crucial roles, maintaining fluid balance, facilitating the transfer of fats from the small intestine to the circulatory system, and transporting foreign substances to lymph nodes for immune monitoring. Lymphatic capillaries feature intercellular clefts, permitting one-way entry of fluid—comprising water, salts, proteins, and bacteria—propelled by tissue compression. These capillaries are adjacent to blood capillaries and venules. Afferent lymphatic trunks, found alongside major blood vessels, contain smooth muscles that rhythmically contract. Each lymphangion, equipped with pacemaker cells, functions akin to a miniature heart, actively pumping fluid forward. Maintaining a compression of 40-50 mmHg is crucial to prevent pumping, notably significant in halting envenomation processes.

In the process of lymphatic drainage, lymph nodes play a pivotal role by reabsorbing certain lymph fluids. Within these nodes, lymphocytes undergo a cycle from the bloodstream to the lymph glands and back to the bloodstream. Notably, within the lymph glands, lymphocytes can become activated upon encountering antigens that enter via the afferent lymphatics. Once the lymphatic journey progresses through the lymph nodes, the efferent lymphatic vessels lead towards either the left or right subclavian vein. Eventually, this fluid re-enters the circulatory system via the thoracic or right subclavian duct, completing the cycle for the lymphocytes and the lymphatic drainage process.

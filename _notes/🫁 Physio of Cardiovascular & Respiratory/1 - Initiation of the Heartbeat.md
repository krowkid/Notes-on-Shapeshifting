###### **PART 1**
The relationship between body mass and physiological variables like oxygen consumption, cardiac output, and heart rate is crucial in understanding how different animals function. As animals grow larger, their oxygen needs increase linearly in relation to their body mass. This heightened oxygen demand directly correlates with an increased cardiac output, a vital mechanism to meet the body's oxygen requirements. Interestingly, larger animals not only demand more oxygen and a higher cardiac output but also require a larger heart to meet these needs effectively. However, there's a curious observation: as the heart grows in size, the heart rate decreases. This phenomenon is due to the challenge of filling the heart's chambers with blood and the subsequent ejection process.

In smaller animals like mice, the heart rate is high because they eject a small volume of blood with each beat. Conversely, larger animals like whales have a tremendous stroke volume, ejecting a vast amount of blood with each heartbeat. The inertia involved in moving such large volumes of blood affects the heart rate, causing it to slow down as the heart grows larger. This limitation due to inertia also impacts high heart rates during exercise, leading to a plateau and eventual decrease in stroke volume. In such cases, the ventricle doesn't have enough time to fill properly between beats, affecting the heart's efficiency.

Notably, there's a clear trend in heart rate and lifespan across different animals: smaller creatures like mice with faster heart rates live shorter lives, while larger animals like whales with slower heart rates live longer. However, humans deviate significantly from this trend. Despite our relatively moderate resting heart rate and extended lifespan, evolutionary predictions suggest a much shorter natural life expectancy based on heart rate alone. This deviation could be attributed to societal and behavioural changes that have prolonged human life beyond what this heart rate-based model predicts. In evolutionary terms, this prolonged lifespan could be seen as an anomaly, as it doesn't align with the expected advantages of having older generations within a species.

The correlation between our lifespan and heart rate seems to suggest an intriguing evolutionary strategy. It's possible that we're designed to live until our offspring are capable of reproduction, after which our role becomes less critical. This implies that the phase from our early twenties to our eighties, where we currently expect to live, might lead to increased vulnerability to chronic diseases. From around 25 years onwards, there's a rise in conditions like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and othersâ€”ailments more characteristic of old age. Animals like zebras don't experience these diseases because they typically don't survive long enough for these conditions to take hold due to natural predation.

This grey area of prolonged life spans beyond our evolutionary norms seems to be a period where our bodies weren't originally designed to function optimally. Chronic diseases appear to be something our biology didn't evolve to cope with effectively. Our responses to these conditions often appear mismatched to their causes, a concept we'll explore further concerning therapeutic approaches.

Interestingly, when we consider the number of heartbeats in a lifetime across species, most creatures, regardless of their size, experience around 3 x 10^8 heartbeats in their lifetime. Humans, however, deviate slightly from this norm, with an approximate count of 30 x 10^8 heartbeats. This deviation prompts considerations about whether exercise consumes or buys heartbeats and their relationship with longevity.

Speaking of longevity, one theory proposes that our inability to replicate DNA effectively as we age contributes to our eventual demise. DNA damage, influenced by oxidative stress and free radical damage, tends to increase as our metabolism rises. Larger animals with lower metabolisms tend to have lower heart rates, leading to less DNA damage and potentially longer lifespans. Conversely, smaller animals with higher metabolisms, such as mice, tend to experience higher heart rates and greater DNA damage.

However, it's essential not to confuse a lower heart rate directly causing longevity. While intriguing, the two factors aren't causally linked, although they do raise intriguing questions about our heart rates and lifespans.

In human studies, heart rate inversely relates to longevity, indicating higher mortality rates in healthy populations with higher resting heart rates. This correlation extends into various cardiovascular conditions, where a higher heart rate often indicates a poorer prognosis post-myocardial infarction or in hypertensive patients with increased mortality rates.

The crucial question arises: is heart rate a causal factor in mortality, or does it simply serve as an indicator of underlying disease severity and stress? Distinguishing between risk factors and indicators becomes pivotal in understanding the therapeutic implications of heart rate in cardiovascular diseases.

###### **PART 2**
Pacemaker tissues in the heart were first discovered by Hermann Stannius, revealing a hierarchy of these structures within a frog's heart. By tying ligatures between specific heart sections, he found that the heart rate slowed progressively. This experiment highlighted the primary pacemaker in the frog heart as the sinus venosus, with secondary slower pacemakers in the atria and the slowest in the ventricle, driven by Purkinje fibers.

Similar structures exist in mammalian hearts. The sinus node, with the fastest intrinsic rate, dictates the heart's rhythm. It initiates the impulse, which travels down the pacemaker structures, setting the tempo for the heart. The atrioventricular node and Bundle of His follow, with increasingly slower intrinsic rates, culminating in the Purkinje fibers.

In a normal heart, these structures harmoniously follow the rhythm dictated by the sinus node. Any deviation, such as faster rates or irregular intervals, leads to cardiac arrhythmias. The primary pacemaker, the SA node, is a tear-drop shaped structure in the right atrium, essential for normal heart function. As we age, changes in this structure contribute to alterations in heart rate. The SA node contains various cell types crucial for its function. The central "P" cells, with minimal organelles, give way to better-organized cells towards the periphery. While once debated, it's now clear that there's a gradual transition from the centre to the edge of the node.

The action potential of SA node cells displays a characteristic shape, notably the 'diastolic depolarization,' crucial for the pacemaker potential. This potential is generated by a combination of inward currents increasing and outward currents decreasing, eventually triggering the action potential. Two theories, the 'Membrane clock' and 'Calcium clock,' explain this rhythmicity. The former involves ion channels in the membrane, while the latter focuses on cyclical calcium release regulating the pacemaker, likely influencing each other. The 'Funny current,' an inward current discovered in Oxford, plays a pivotal role in the Membrane Clock theory. It operates uniquely by activating when the membrane hyperpolarizes. This current, along with other ion currents, contributes to the pacemaker depolarization during diastole. Both the Membrane and Calcium Clock mechanisms coexist and interact, modulating each other. While the Membrane Clock is the primary driver, changes in intracellular calcium release can fine-tune its function. neurotransmitters like noradrenaline and acetylcholine can also influence these mechanisms.

The heart rate is governed by intrinsic pacemaker cells within the sinoatrial node, influenced primarily by sympathetic and parasympathetic stimulation. Sympathetic activity accelerates the heart rate, while parasympathetic activity decelerates it. When acetylcholine binds to muscarinic receptors, it activates a receptor-operated potassium channel (IK(ACh)) directly, without involving an intracellular second messenger. Most regulation of heart rate occurs downstream via cAMP. Acetylcholine reduces cAMP levels, while noradrenaline or adrenaline binding to beta receptors increases cAMP.

The sympathetic nervous system heightens heart rate by elevating cAMP, affecting the funny current channel and activating Protein Kinase A. This leads to increased diastolic depolarization and heart rate. Conversely, the parasympathetic nervous system, via acetylcholine and muscarinic receptors, decreases cAMP levels, inhibiting the funny current. Pharmacologically, various drugs, such as beta blockers, L-type calcium channel blockers, anaesthetic agents, antiarrhythmic drugs, and digoxin, can alter heart rate by targeting different parts of the pacemaker mechanism. Ivabradine, licensed as Procoralan, specifically targets the funny current and slows heart rate.

Ivabradine blocks a significant portion of the funny current without halting the sinoatrial node entirely. This redundancy in ion currents within the node serves as a fail-safe mechanism, crucial in clinical settings to prevent cardiac arrest due to overdosing. The funny current is carried by HCN channels, which consist of four subunits with voltage-sensing properties. These channels are activated by cAMP binding to their Cyclic Nucleotide Binding Domain, influencing the heart's electrical activity. The activation curve for HCN channels demonstrates the channels' availability for opening at different cell membrane voltages. Beta stimulation shifts this curve to the right, increasing available channels and heart rate, while acetylcholine shifts it to the left, reducing available channels and heart rate.

Ultimately, the autonomic nervous system primarily regulates heart rate. Sympathetic stimulation increases heart rate and conduction, while parasympathetic stimulation decreases heart rate and conduction through the AV node, illustrating their 'fight or flight' and 'rest and digest' responses, respectively. Both the SA and AV nodes receive abundant innervation from both branches of the autonomic nervous system.

Heart rate regulation involves the sympathetic nervous system, acting as an accelerator, and the parasympathetic system, acting as a brake. Analogously, our heart functions with a foot on each, slightly accelerating and decelerating simultaneously. This equilibrium is evident in our resting heart rate of approximately 72 beats per minute. Using beta blockers slows the heart rate to less than 60 beats per minute, indicating a baseline sympathetic influence. In contrast, inhibiting the parasympathetic system, either with atropine or by cutting the vagus nerve during heart transport, increases the intrinsic heart rate to around 90 beats per minute, demonstrating the joint control of both autonomic branches at rest.

During gradual exercise, the initial rise in heart rate from rest to about 90 beats per minute mainly occurs due to the withdrawal of vagal tone, essentially 'taking our foot off the brake'. As we engage in day-to-day movements or mild activities like climbing stairs, changes in heart rate primarily stem from alterations in vagal tone. Even during exercise, this initial increase to 90 beats per minute results mainly from reducing vagal influence.

However, for more intense exercise requiring a higher heart rate, sympathetic activation comes into play. This involves the release of adrenaline and noradrenaline from sympathetic nerve terminals and adrenal glands.

Understanding key terms related to heart rate is crucial. "Chronotropic" refers to heart rate changes, where a positive agent increases heart rate and a negative agent decreases it. Additionally, "inotropy" determines the strength of contraction, while "lusitropy" governs the rate of relaxation. Lusitropy is significant for diastolic function, representing how effectively the heart relaxes between beats. Positive inotropic agents enhance contraction strength, while positive lusitropic agents expedite relaxation.

###### **PART 1**
The human respiratory system is an intricate network vital for the exchange of gases, primarily oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2), crucial for sustaining life. The process of respiration involves several key steps, each contributing to the effective exchange and utilization of these gases. Ventilation marks the initial step, entailing the movement of air in and out of the lungs through bulk flow. This process is integral to facilitating gas exchange within the respiratory system. The subsequent step involves the exchange of O2 and CO2 between the alveolar air and the blood within lung capillaries, accomplished through the mechanism of diffusion. This crucial exchange occurs at the respiratory surface, ensuring the transfer of oxygen into the bloodstream and the removal of carbon dioxide from it.

Transportation of O2 and CO2 through the pulmonary and systemic circulation follows. Bulk flow mechanisms aid in the movement of these gases, facilitating their distribution to tissues and organs where they are required for metabolic processes. Further gas exchange between the blood in capillaries and respiring tissues occurs via diffusion, allowing for the delivery of oxygen to cells engaged in metabolic activities and the removal of resultant carbon dioxide. Ultimately, cellular utilization of oxygen and the production of carbon dioxide take place within the respiring tissues, where oxygen fuels cellular processes and carbon dioxide is generated as a metabolic byproduct.

The lungs play a pivotal role as the primary respiratory organs, serving as the site for gas exchange between the external environment and the bloodstream. The respired tissues actively engage in metabolic processes, consuming oxygen and producing carbon dioxide as part of cellular respiration. The flow of air in and out of the lungs is referred to as ventilation, a process governed by factors like air pressure differentials. According to Boyle's Law, pressure is inversely proportional to volume. Consequently, changes in lung volume induce pressure alterations, thereby facilitating the movement of air during inspiration and expiration. Inspiration involves a decrease in alveolar pressure (Palv) below atmospheric pressure (PB), resulting in an increased lung volume that allows air to flow into the lungs. Conversely, during expiration, alveolar pressure exceeds atmospheric pressure, leading to decreased lung volume and the expulsion of air from the lungs.

The process of breathing, known as respiration, involves intricate movements of muscles that regulate the expansion and contraction of the chest cavity, thereby facilitating the exchange of gases. At the heart of this mechanism lie the respiratory muscles, primarily the diaphragm, responsible for initiating the breathing cycle.The diaphragm, the primary muscle of inspiration, contracts during inhalation. This contraction results in the diaphragm pulling downwards, effectively enlarging the chest cavity. Alongside the diaphragm, several other muscles contribute to this process, including the sternomastoid, scalene, pectoralis major, and external intercostals. As these muscles engage, the chest volume increases, leading to a decrease in pressure within the lungs. This decrease in pressure prompts air to flow into the lungs, facilitating inhalation.

Conversely, during exhalation, the diaphragm relaxes, moving upwards. This relaxation, combined with the passive recoil of the lungs, causes the chest volume to decrease, resulting in increased pressure within the lungs. Consequently, air flows out of the lungs. Additional respiratory muscles assist the diaphragm in its function. Inspiratory muscles, including the external intercostals, aid in expanding the chest cavity during quiet breathing, which occurs at rest. During this phase, the diaphragm contracts along with these obligate inspiratory muscles to enable inhalation. In situations requiring forced breathing, such as during exercise, the breathing pattern intensifies. For inspiration, a more forceful contraction of the diaphragm occurs, along with the recruitment of accessory muscles to further enlarge the chest cavity. Contrastingly, during forced expiration, the abdominals and internal intercostals contract, assisting in reducing the chest cavity size and expelling air from the lungs.

The intricate movements of the ribs orchestrate the expansion of the chest cavity, facilitating breathing in three dimensions. This expansion of the chest cavity, crucially, leads to the expansion of the lungs, in contrast to the misconception that it's the other way around. The ribs' movements, particularly their superior and anterior motion, are pivotal in this process. As the ribs move, the sternum undergoes superior and anterior movement, akin to a pump handle motion. This action is known as the pump handle movement, where the sternum elevates, allowing the chest to expand in the superior direction. Moreover, the ribs' lateral shaft also undergoes elevation, similar to the motion of a bucket handle being lifted. This bucket handle movement further contributes to the chest cavity's expansion, allowing for increased lung capacity.

The expansion of the chest cavity leads to the expansion of the lungs through a complex interplay of pressures and membrane cohesion within the thoracic cavity. The pleural membranes, along with the layer of fluid between them, create cohesion between the inner surface of the chest cavity and the surface of the lungs. This connection is crucial as the pressure between the pleura, referred to as intrapleural pressure (P), generally maintains a slightly negative value. As the chest cavity expands during inhalation, this expansion leads to a decrease in intrapleural pressure (P1). Simultaneously, the transpulmonary pressure (PL), which is the pressure across the lung wall, increases due to this fall in intrapleural pressure. This rise in transpulmonary pressure (PL) effectively causes the expansion of the lungs.

The diaphragm plays a pivotal role in this process. Typically, at rest, the intrapleural pressure (Pp) remains at a negative value, around -0.5 kPa (-5 cm H2O). As the diaphragm contracts during inhalation, it causes the thoracic cavity to expand, thereby reducing the intrapleural pressure (P1) even further. This decrease in intrapleural pressure allows the lungs to be stretched during inspiration. However, owing to their elastic nature, the lungs recoil inward when the thorax returns to its original volume during exhalation. Understanding the pressures at play, particularly the transmural pressures, aids in predicting lung movements. Transmural pressures, calculated as the pressure differential between the inside and outside compartments, are critical in determining lung inflation. Notably, the transpulmonary pressure, transchest wall pressure, and the overall trans-total system pressure, denoted as P, play essential roles in inflating the lungs when their values become more positive.

###### **PART 2**
Atmospheric pressure serves as the baseline, registering at 0 cm H2O. When there's no airflow, the pressure within the alveoli aligns with atmospheric pressure. This equilibrium marks the point where the forces inside the chest reach a balance: the alveolar pressure matches the atmospheric pressure, maintaining stability. However, within the pleural cavity, the intrapleural pressure measures at -5 cm H2O. This negative pressure is critical as it counters the inward elastic recoil of the lungs. Essentially, it prevents the collapse of the lungs by exerting an outward force against the lung's natural tendency to recoil inwards.

During the process of inhalation, the dynamics change significantly. The inspiratory muscles contract, expanding the thoracic cavity. This expansion reduces both the intrapleural and airway pressure, thereby increasing the transpulmonary pressure (P1). This transpulmonary pressure, often termed the lung distending pressure, signifies the pressure difference between the intrapleural and alveolar pressures. A higher P1 indicates greater work of breathing and increased difficulty in inhalation. Consequently, this muscular action alters the pressures within the thoracic cavity. The intrapleural pressure drops to around -8 cm H2O, amplifying the negative pressure below the baseline, which aids in countering the lung's natural recoil.

Moreover, the alveolar pressure diminishes to facilitate air intake. When the alveolar pressure falls below atmospheric pressure, air rushes into the lungs, initiating the inhalation process. The shift in pressure creates a transmural pressure of around +7 cm H2O. This pressure, calculated as the difference between alveolar and intrapleural pressures, represents the force that helps maintain the lung's structural integrity.

The respiratory system orchestrates breathing through a series of intricate volume and pressure changes. As the diaphragm and accessory muscles contract, the chest cavity expands, augmenting its volume. This expansion leads to a drop in intrapleural pressure, rendering it more negative. Simultaneously, the transpulmonary pressure increases, causing the alveoli within the lungs to expand, consequently reducing alveolar pressure. This disparity in pressures, with alveolar pressure now less than atmospheric pressure, facilitates the influx of air into the lungs, driving the process of inspiration.

Upon expiration, the respiratory muscles relax, reversing the process. The pressures involved are all relative to atmospheric pressure, denoted as P_B, which remains at 0 at the onset and conclusion of both inspiration and expiration. Notably, during expiration, the alveolar pressure may become positive, facilitating the outward flow of air. Functional Residual Capacity (FRC) denotes the lung volume at the end of a normal, unforced expiration. During forced expiration, the pleural pressure might become positive, aiding in expelling additional air from the lungs. The flow of air, indicated by positive or negative values, signifies inspiration or expiration, respectively. Tidal volume, the volume of air exchanged during normal breathing, and time elapsed are key parameters influencing these pressure and volume changes.

In the respiratory system, the intrapleural pressure is typically negative, maintaining a delicate balance between the inward recoil of the lungs and the outward recoil of the chest wall. This equilibrium is sustained by the cohesion facilitated by the pleural fluid. Under normal conditions, at the functional residual capacity (FRC), the inward recoil of the lungs is counteracted by the outward recoil of the chest wall, a dynamic interplay that ensures stability. However, disruptions such as chest wounds or pneumothorax can upset this equilibrium. For instance, in the case of a chest wound, air can infiltrate the pleural space, equalizing the intrapleural pressure with atmospheric pressure. This intrusion of air into the pleural cavity causes the lung to collapse, driven by its natural inward elastic recoil, no longer opposed by the counteracting force of the chest wall. Conversely, as the lung collapses, the chest wall, freed from the opposing force of the lungs, expands outward to its resting state, driven by its inherent outward elastic recoil. This scenario accentuates the significance of the negative intrapleural pressure in maintaining the stability and functionality of the respiratory system.

Minute ventilation refers to the total volume of air breathed in and out in a minute, measured in litres per minute (L/min). It's calculated by multiplying the breathing rate (R) by the tidal volume (V1). At rest, the breathing rate typically stands at 15 breaths per minute, with a tidal volume of 500 millilitres (ml). Multiplying these figures (15 breaths/minute x 500 ml) gives us 7500 ml/min or 7.5 L/min. This equation mirrors the one used to determine cardiac output, the total blood flow, which is derived from heart rate (HR) and stroke volume (SV).

Dead space in the respiratory system refers to the volume of the airways where no gas exchange occurs. There are two main types: anatomical and physiological. Anatomical dead space encompasses all areas except for the alveoli and respiratory bronchioles and typically accounts for a volume of around 150ml. Physiological dead space includes the anatomical dead space and areas where gas exchange is dysfunctional. In healthy individuals, physiological dead space is approximately equal to anatomical dead space, but it tends to increase in respiratory diseases.

Alveolar ventilation refers to the amount of fresh air reaching the alveoli per minute, which is crucial for gas exchange. In a typical breath with a tidal volume of 500 ml, 150 ml remains in the anatomical dead space, leaving 350 ml reaching the alveoli. Hence, of the 500 ml tidal volume, 350 ml is available for gaseous exchange, while the remaining 150 ml stays in the conducting zone without participating in gas transfer. Alveolar ventilation is calculated by subtracting dead space ventilation from minute ventilation. Using the earlier figures, this translates to (500 ml x 15) - (150 ml x 15) = 5250 ml/min. This means that after accounting for dead space, 5250 ml of air per minute reaches the alveoli for effective gas exchange.

###### **PART 3**
Breathing requires the respiratory muscles to overcome two key resistances: the elastic resistance of the lung and the airway resistance to airflow. Common lung diseases often raise one or both of these resistances, intensifying the work of breathing and causing symptoms like breathlessness (dyspnoea). Elastic resistance relates to the lung tissues' stretch and the interface lining the alveoli, while airway resistance stems from friction between air layers and airway walls during flow.

Air moves through airways due to a pressure gradient between the mouth and alveoli, determined by the difference in alveolar and intrapleural pressure. The flow of air (flow) is dictated by the pressure gradient (AP/R) across the airways from the mouth to the alveoli. Airway resistance (RAW) is defined as the difference between alveolar and mouth pressure divided by the airflow at the mouth. Resistance is influenced by the distinction between laminar flow and turbulence. Factors such as high velocity, sharp edges, and branch points, especially in larger tubes, can disrupt laminar flow, inducing turbulence and significantly increasing resistance. This turbulence can cause vibrations, producing audible lung sounds when there is high-velocity airflow due to narrowed airways.

Wheezes arise from airway walls oscillating near points of closure, indicating airway obstruction. Notably, they need a reasonable airflow to manifest and might vanish if the obstruction becomes severe. In severe asthma, when airway narrowing reaches a critical point, it can result in the absence of wheezing, leading to a worrying condition termed the ominous "silent chest." The Law of Flow, akin to Darcy's Law, states that flow in tubes is directly linked to the pressure difference (P1-P2) and inversely proportional to the resistance to flow (R). This relationship is similar to Ohm's Law in electrical circuits, where pressure corresponds to voltage, flow to current, and resistance to current flow.

Resistance to flow is determined by Poiseuille's Law, which relates it to various factors: the length of the tube (L), the radius of the tube (r), and the viscosity of the fluid (V). According to this law, if the radius is halved, resistance increases 16-fold, leading to a proportional reduction in flow by 1/16th, assuming the same pressure gradient. In the respiratory system, airway resistance occurs primarily in the nose, pharynx, larynx, medium-sized bronchi within the lungs, and smaller distal airways. Although smaller airways individually possess higher resistance, their numerous presence in parallel leads to a lower net resistance. Medium-sized bronchi, specifically around generation 3-5, contribute significantly to overall airway resistance.

Variations in airway resistance (RAW) are influenced by two primary factors: a) Factors within the airways: These include bronchial smooth muscle tone, inflammation of the epithelium leading to gland hypertrophy and increased secretions, such as mucus. In normal breathing with negative intrapleural pressure, airways remain open. However, during forced expiration with positive intrapleural pressure, there's a collapsing force exerted on the airways. b) Pressure across the airway wall: Normal bronchioles experience negative intrapleural pressure, ensuring the airways are kept open. Conversely, in asthmatic bronchioles or during forced expiration with positive intrapleural pressure, there's a collapsing force acting on the airways.

Local factors significantly affecting airway resistance encompass various substances and reflexes: CO2 levels from the alveoli influence inhibitory Non-Adrenergic Non-Cholinergic (NANC) agents like NO (Nitric Oxide) and VIP (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide), causing bronchodilation or bronchoconstriction. Adrenaline, released into the blood or administered as beta agonists, can induce bronchodilator. Inflammatory mediators such as histamine, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and certain neuropeptides like Substance P (SP) and neurokinins act as excitatory elements, potentially increasing airway resistance. Airway stretch receptors and the vagal reflex (mediated by Acetylcholine) can also influence airway resistance in response to stimuli or irritants.

Dynamic compression of airways occurs during respiration, particularly before inspiration and more so if resistance is high. Airway pressures fluctuate between positive and negative values during inspiration and expiration. The airways most prone to collapse, typically bronchi around generation 3 or 4, experience this dynamic compression due to falling pressures within the airways below intrapleural pressure (Pip) during forced expiration. This compression restricts expiratory airflow, remaining "effort independent" even in normal individuals and limiting airflow augmentation at low lung volumes.

###### PART 4
Lung compliance refers to the stretchiness or elasticity of the lungs when subjected to positive pressure ventilation. It is assessed by measuring the change in lung volume against the change in transpulmonary pressure, which is the force causing lung expansion. This pressure rises with positive pressure and decreases when there's a drop in the pleural pressure. The ease with which the lungs expand against pressure determines the workload for respiratory muscles. Measuring lung compliance involves calculating the transmural pressure gradient, derived from the alveolar and intrapleural pressures. Alveolar pressure, although challenging to measure directly, is typically considered zero in the absence of airflow (atmospheric pressure). Intrapleural pressure, measured using an oesophageal balloon, aids in this calculation.

Utilizing a spirometer, volume changes from functional residual capacity (FRC) to total lung capacity (TLC) are recorded as the subject inhales in increments. At each interval, while breath-holding, measurements of inspired volume and intrapleural pressure construct a static pressure-volume loop for analysis. This process involves monitoring intrapleural pressure at around -0.5 kPa, measured via an oesophageal balloon, and inferring alveolar pressure at atmospheric levels when airflow is absent.

The static pressure-volume loop illustrates lung volumes and capacities like Total Lung Capacity (TLC), reached at maximum inhalation, and Functional Residual Capacity (FRC), at the end of a normal exhalation.  Lung compliance, typically highest around normal tidal volumes, is calculated by dividing the change in lung volume by the change in transpulmonary pressure (PL). This pressure, measured in kilopascals (kPa), affects factors like the slope of the curve on the graph. Residual Volume (RV) marks the remaining air after maximum exhalation, while compliance, reflecting the slope of the curve, varies between individuals. For an adult male, the typical value of lung compliance stands at 1.5 L.kPa⁻¹, with variations according to body size. High compliance, associated with conditions like emphysema due to tissue destruction, contrasts with low compliance observed in stiff lungs, often due to conditions like lung fibrosis causing scarring. Alterations in compliance influence lung volumes and can be visualized on the pressure-volume loop.

Pathological findings indicate: upper left shows diffuse fibrosis, while the lower right exhibits a honeycomb appearance. Histology shows fibrous tissue, inflammatory cells, and scarring. Fibrosis results from excessive collagen deposition. Manifestations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) include: Healthy bronchioles and alveoli affected by bronchiolitis. Thickened, narrowed bronchioles with increased mucus. Destruction of alveolar walls characteristic of emphysema. Emphysema entails tissue destruction primarily at the centre of the lungs. In centrilobar emphysema, the alveoli at the centre are relatively normal while destruction occurs around them. This breakdown affects the alveolar walls and impacts the gross morphology. Elastic resistance in the lungs arises from elastin, collagen, and the air-fluid interface in alveoli. Stretching this interface requires overcoming its surface tension.

Surface tension refers to the force per unit length resulting from cohesive forces among water molecules, which are particularly strong at the air-water interface. In the context of alveoli, these tiny air sacs in the lungs are lined with fluid, creating an air-fluid interface with surface tension. Alveolar air pressure (P) correlates with tension (T) and the radius (r) of the alveolus according to the equation P = 2T r. This means that for alveoli with equal surface tension, smaller ones will experience greater pressure. Surface tension opposes alveolar expansion and reduces compliance—the ability to stretch. Since alveoli naturally differ in size, if they have the same surface tension, the smaller alveoli will experience higher pressure (PR > PA). This pressure difference due to varying radii leads to airflow from the larger (B) to the smaller (A) alveoli. Consequently, compliance is affected, and the larger alveolus may collapse, impairing the exchange of gases.

Surfactant, a blend of phospholipids (like phosphatidylcholine) and surfactant proteins (SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, and SP-D), works by decreasing the surface tension of the alveolar lining fluid. Phospholipids, with one end insoluble in water and the other hydrophilic, float on the fluid's surface, reducing surface tension proportionally to their concentration. Secreted by type II pneumocytes, surfactant plays a crucial role in maintaining compliance by reducing surface tension. When comparing larger (A) to smaller or shrinking (B) alveoli, surfactant concentration is higher in the latter, lowering surface tension in B. Consequently, the pressure equation P = 2T r no longer results in a pressure difference between the alveoli (PA = PB). With equal pressures, airflow from B to A ceases. This preservation of compliance prevents the collapse of alveoli (B), ensuring continued gaseous exchange without compromise.

Premature birth can lead to complications like Neonatal Respiratory Distress Syndrome due to a lack of surfactant production. This syndrome results in increased breathing effort, reduced lung compliance, and alveolar collapse. Communication between alveoli helps maintain pressure equality, while lung compliance abnormalities can lead to stiff (low compliance) or floppy (high compliance) lungs. Causes include lung fibrosis, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome due to insufficient surfactant, and conditions like emphysema caused by reduced lung tissue.

###### PART 5
The respiratory system can encounter two main types of health conditions: obstructive lung disease and restrictive lung disease. Obstructive lung diseases, such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, and COPD, hinder airflow due to narrowed airways or damage to lung tissues. Asthma involves reversible airflow blockages caused by narrowed airways, while chronic bronchitis is characterized by damaged airway walls and increased mucus production. Emphysema involves the destruction of air sacs in the lungs, leading to poorly supported airways. On the other hand, restrictive lung diseases, like lung fibrosis and respiratory muscle weakness, limit lung expansion. Lung fibrosis results in stiffened lung tissue due to scar formation, hampering normal breathing, while respiratory muscle weakness reduces the efficiency of the muscles involved in breathing.

Lung function measurements involve assessing airway resistance, typically measured using a body plethysmograph or simpler tests for high resistance. Indirect assessments are made through forced expiratory maneuvers, measuring peak flow (liters per minute) and forced expiratory volumes like FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) and FVC (forced vital capacity). During these tests, the subject inhales to total lung capacity and exhales forcefully. Analyzing forced expiratory spirograms (volume vs time graphs) aids in distinguishing between obstructive and restrictive lung diseases. FEV1 and FVC pattern changes help differentiate these conditions. Normally, the ratio of FEV1 to FVC exceeds 75%.

In a healthy individual, all parameters—FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC—are normal. In obstructive disease, FEV1 decreases significantly, while FVC might remain normal, leading to a decreased FEV1/FVC ratio. In contrast, in restrictive disease, both FEV1 and FVC decrease, yet the FEV1/FVC ratio could be normal or increased due to a proportional reduction in both values.

The maximum flow-volume loops distinguish between obstructive and restrictive airway diseases. Obstructive conditions, like COPD, show a concave forced expiratory curve and a more significant impact on forced expiratory flow than forced inspiratory flow. Restrictive lung diseases exhibit low peak flow rates associated with reduced lung volumes. Understanding compliance is crucial: stiff lungs, as in lung fibrosis, have low compliance (high elastic resistance), reducing functional residual capacity (FRC) due to increased lung recoil. Conversely, emphysema, with tissue destruction, increases lung compliance, enlarging FRC (barrel chest). In respiratory muscle weakness, both lung and chest wall recoils remain normal, maintaining a normal FRC.

- Variations influenced by factors within airways and pressure across airway walls

##### What local factors affect airway resistance?
- CO2 levels influencing NANC agents like NO and VIP, inducing bronchodilation or bronchoconstriction
- Inflammatory mediators and neuropeptides potentially increasing resistance
- Airway stretch receptors, vagal reflex, and adrenaline affecting resistance in response to stimuli

##### Explain dynamic compression of airways during respiration.
- Occurs before inspiration and in high resistance cases
- Airways collapse due to falling pressures below intrapleural pressure during forced expiration


##### What is lung compliance, and how is it measured?
- Lung elasticity under positive pressure ventilation; measured by change in lung volume against transpulmonary pressure
- Measured using spirometer, changes from FRC to TLC recorded in increments during inhalation

##### How is lung compliance calculated, and what does it reflect?
- Change in lung volume divided by change in transpulmonary pressure (PL)
- Reflects ease of lung expansion against pressure; typically highest around normal tidal volumes

##### What factors influence lung compliance, and how does it vary in different conditions?
- High compliance in emphysema due to tissue destruction; low compliance in stiff lungs like lung fibrosis causing scarring

##### How do surface tension and surface forces affect alveolar expansion?
- Surface tension from water molecules at air-fluid interface opposes alveolar expansion
- Smaller alveoli experience greater pressure, leading to airflow from larger to smaller alveoli, impacting compliance

##### What role does surfactant play in maintaining lung compliance?
- Decreases surface tension in alveoli, ensuring equal pressures in larger and smaller alveoli, preventing collapse
- Prevents alveolar collapse, ensuring continued gaseous exchange

##### How does Neonatal Respiratory Distress Syndrome relate to lung compliance and surfactant?
- Syndrome due to insufficient surfactant, leading to increased breathing effort, reduced lung compliance, and alveolar collapse
- Abnormalities in lung compliance can result in stiff (low compliance) or floppy (high compliance) lungs due to various conditions

##### What are the two main types of health conditions that the respiratory system can encounter?
- Obstructive lung disease
- Restrictive lung disease

##### What are some examples of obstructive lung diseases, and how do they affect airflow?
- Asthma: Reversible airflow blockages due to narrowed airways
- Chronic bronchitis: Damaged airway walls and increased mucus production
- COPD: Hindered airflow caused by narrowed airways or lung tissue damage

##### What characterizes asthma and chronic bronchitis?
- Asthma: Narrowed airways causing reversible airflow blockages
- Chronic bronchitis: Damaged airway walls and increased mucus production

##### What happens in emphysema?
- Destruction of air sacs in the lungs, leading to poorly supported airways

##### How do restrictive lung diseases limit lung expansion?
- Lung fibrosis: Stiffened lung tissue due to scar formation, hampering normal breathing
- Respiratory muscle weakness: Reduces the efficiency of muscles involved in breathing

##### What is involved in lung function measurements?
- Assessing airway resistance
- Measuring peak flow (liters per minute), FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second), and FVC (forced vital capacity)
- Analyzing forced expiratory spirograms (volume vs time graphs)

##### What do changes in FEV1 and FVC patterns help differentiate?
- Obstructive and restrictive lung diseases

##### What is the normal ratio of FEV1 to FVC?
- Exceeds 75%

##### What changes are observed in lung function parameters in obstructive and restrictive diseases?
- Obstructive disease: Decreased FEV1, possibly normal FVC, leading to decreased FEV1/FVC ratio
- Restrictive disease: Decreased FEV1 and FVC, potentially normal or increased FEV1/FVC ratio due to proportional reduction in both values

##### How are obstructive and restrictive airway diseases distinguished using maximum flow-volume loops?
- Obstructive conditions show a concave forced expiratory curve and a greater impact on forced expiratory flow than forced inspiratory flow
- Restrictive lung diseases exhibit low peak flow rates associated with reduced lung volumes

##### Why is understanding compliance crucial in lung diseases?
- Stiff lungs (lung fibrosis) have low compliance, reducing functional residual capacity (FRC) due to increased lung recoil
- Emphysema increases lung compliance, enlarging FRC (barrel chest)
- In respiratory muscle weakness, lung and chest wall recoils remain normal, maintaining a normal FRC

###### **PART 1**
The systemic circulation involves the pathway of oxygen-depleted blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs. This occurs through the pulmonary trunk, which carries the deoxygenated blood to the lungs for gas exchange. After the blood is oxygenated in the lungs, it returns to the left side of the heart via the pulmonary veins. From there, the oxygen-rich blood is pumped out to the rest of the body through the aorta, delivering oxygen and nutrients to the major systems and regions.

In contrast, the pulmonary circulation is responsible for sending oxygen-depleted blood to the lungs from the right side of the heart through the pulmonary trunk. In the lungs, gas exchange occurs, and the oxygen-rich blood is then transported back to the left side of the heart via the pulmonary veins, ready to become part of the systemic circulation once again.

The heart's chambers and the double circulation in adults are essential components of the cardiovascular system. The heart is divided into a right side and a left side, with the right side serving the pulmonary system and the left side serving the systemic system. The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the venae cavae, which then passes to the right ventricle and subsequently to the pulmonary trunk. On the other hand, the left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the pulmonary veins, which then passes to the left ventricle before being ejected via the aorta to the rest of the body. This double circulation ensures that both the pulmonary and systemic systems are supplied with the necessary blood volumes.

Fetal circulation differs from adult circulation in that before birth, there is no need for a pulmonary circulation as the lungs are not yet functional. The fetal circulation includes two ways in which blood bypasses the pulmonary system: the foramen ovale, a hole in the atrial septum, and the ductus arteriosus, a vessel connecting the pulmonary trunk to the aorta. These structures allow blood to bypass the non-functional pulmonary system, ensuring proper circulation in the fetus. However, issues may arise with persistent fetal structures after birth, leading to problems such as patent foramen ovale and patent ductus arteriosus. At birth, changes take place in the circulation as the lungs become functional, and the fetal structures, such as the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus, should close. Failure of these structures to close properly can lead to persistent fetal circulation issues post-birth.

The right atrium contains several important structures. The auricle, also known as the right auricle, is a small, ear-shaped extension located in front of the aorta. The anterior wall of the right atrium is composed of muscular ridges called musculi pectinati, which arise from a vertical ridge known as the crista terminalis. The crista terminalis is an important part of the electrical conducting system of the heart, housing the sinu-atrial node. The posterior wall of the right atrium is smooth and is known as the sinus venarum. On the septal wall of the sinus venarum, there is a depression called the fossa ovalis, which is a remnant of the foramen ovale of the fetus. There are three openings into the right atrium: the superior vena cava, inferior vena cava, and the coronary sinus. The exit route out of the right atrium is via the right atrioventricular valve, also known as the tricuspid valve, which has three cusps.

Cardiac ultrasound imaging, including parasternal short axis ultrasound, provides valuable information about the ventricles. Parasternal short axis ultrasound allows for a good appreciation of the ventricles' shapes and differences between the left and right ventricles in terms of thickness and pressure systems. The left ventricle is thicker-walled and operates at a higher pressure, while the right ventricle is thinner-walled and operates at a lower pressure.

The right ventricle contains several important features. The chordae tendineae are fibrous cords that connect the tricuspid valve to the papillary muscles, preventing the valve from inverting into the atrium during ventricular contraction. The papillary muscles are cone-shaped muscles that anchor the chordae tendineae and prevent the tricuspid valve from prolapsing into the right atrium. Another unique feature of the right ventricle is the moderator band, a muscular band that crosses the cavity of the right ventricle, supporting the conus arteriosus, which is the outflow tract of the right ventricle leading to the pulmonary trunk. Developmental issues can lead to defects like ventricular septal defects (VSDs), where there is an abnormal opening in the septum between the right and left ventricles, allowing blood to flow between the two chambers.

The left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the pulmonary veins and is entirely smooth-walled internally, except for the auricle, which is a remnant of the original atrial chamber in the embryo. The left ventricle is larger and has thicker walls compared to the right ventricle. It features the mitral valve, a bicuspid valve with two cusps, which separates the left atrium from the left ventricle. Unlike the right ventricle, the left ventricle lacks a moderator band and septal papillae. The outlet of the left ventricle is to the aorta, and the smooth-walled portion of the interventricular septum leads up to the aortic semilunar valve.

###### **PART 2**
The key components of the heart's four-chambered structure include the left and right atria, which receive blood from the pulmonary veins and venae cavae, and the left and right ventricles, which pump blood out of the heart to the rest of the body. The pulmonary veins bring oxygenated blood from the lungs to the left atrium, while the superior and inferior venae cavae bring deoxygenated blood from the body to the right atrium. This separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood is crucial for efficient circulation.

The membranous and muscular portions of the interventricular septum are significant because they separate the left and right ventricles, preventing the mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. This ensures that oxygen-rich blood is pumped to the body and oxygen-poor blood is sent to the lungs for reoxygenation, supporting overall heart function. The electrical impulse travels through the heart starting from the sinoatrial node (SAN), which is located in the right atrium. The impulse then travels to the atrioventricular node (AVN), followed by the bundle of His and the Purkinje fibers, which spread the electrical signal throughout the ventricles, causing them to contract in a coordinated manner.

The bundle of His and the Purkinje fibers play a crucial role in heart function by rapidly transmitting the electrical impulse from the AVN to the ventricles, ensuring synchronized and efficient contraction of the heart muscle, leading to effective pumping of blood throughout the body. The conduction is limited by the cardiac skeleton, which is composed of dense connective tissue. This limits the spread of electrical impulses, ensuring that the atria and ventricles contract in a coordinated sequence, allowing for efficient pumping of blood and preventing chaotic contractions that could compromise heart function.

The mechanisms of parasympathetic and sympathetic control over heart rate involve the autonomic nervous system. Parasympathetic control, mediated by the vagus nerve, slows down the heart rate through tonal control from the medulla oblongata, while sympathetic control, through the sympathetic nerve supply, increases heart rate and the force of ventricular contraction.

Baroreceptors in the aorta and carotid sinus influence heart rate by responding to changes in blood pressure. If blood pressure falls too low, the vagal tone is reduced, allowing the heart to speed up. Conversely, if pressure is sensed to be too high, there is a reflex increase in vagal tone to reduce the heart rate. The sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves are located in the cardiac plexus, which is a network of nerves located in front and behind the aortic arch. They mingle together in this plexus before being distributed to the heart.

The internal and common carotid arteries are relevant to the heart's function as they supply blood to the brain, and the baroreceptors in the carotid sinus, which is where the common carotid artery branches, play a role in influencing heart rate through the autonomic nervous system. The cervical ganglia play a role in distributing sympathetic and parasympathetic cardiac nerves. Postganglionic neurons emerge from the superior, middle, and inferior cervical sympathetic ganglia, and the vagus nerve carries the parasympathetic nerves to the heart. The autonomic nervous system impacts heart function through the neck region by regulating the distribution of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves to the heart, influencing heart rate and the force of ventricular contraction.

Atrial fibrillation is characterized by irregular and often rapid heart rate, which can lead to poor blood flow and an increased risk of stroke. It is often caused by conditions such as high blood pressure, heart attacks, abnormal heart valves, and overactive thyroid glands. Atrial fibrillation can also occur in individuals with no underlying heart disease. Tachycardia refers to a rapid heart rate, typically above 100 beats per minute. It can be caused by various factors, including stress, anxiety, strenuous physical activity, fever, and certain medications. Tachycardia can also be a symptom of an underlying medical condition, such as heart disease, anemia, or hyperthyroidism.

Ventricular fibrillation differs from other cardiac arrhythmias in that it is a life-threatening condition characterized by rapid, erratic electrical impulses in the heart's ventricles. This chaotic activity causes the heart to quiver rather than effectively pump blood, leading to a sudden loss of consciousness and, if not treated immediately, death. Ventricular fibrillation is often associated with underlying heart disease, electrolyte imbalances, or severe physical stress.

The potential implications of a new pacemaker developing in the heart can lead to various arrhythmias. If the new pacemaker is located in the atria, it can cause atrial arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation. Similarly, if the new pacemaker is located in the ventricles, it can lead to ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. These arrhythmias can disrupt the heart's normal rhythm and lead to serious complications, including decreased cardiac output and an increased risk of stroke or sudden cardiac arrest.

Defibrillation is a critical emergency treatment used to manage cardiac issues such as ventricular fibrillation. It involves delivering a controlled electrical current through pads placed on the patient's chest. The purpose of defibrillation is to restore the heart's normal electrical activity and pumping mechanism. This is achieved by disrupting the chaotic electrical activity in the heart, allowing the muscle cells to depolarize and re-establishing a normal pacemaker, thus restoring the heart's conduction pathways.

An artificial cardiac pacemaker is a device that is used to regulate the heart's rhythm when the heart cannot maintain its own rhythm at a suitable pace. It is typically placed under the skin over the chest wall and is battery-driven. The pacemaker delivers a regulated impulse and is responsive to the body's needs, with sensory monitors that coordinate the electrical pulse. The wires from the pacemaker are fed into the right atrium and the right ventricle, ensuring that an atrial depolarization can precede a ventricular one.

The indications for using an artificial pacemaker in heart-related conditions include bradycardia (a slow heart rate), heart block, and certain types of arrhythmias. It is also used in cases where the heart's electrical conduction system is not functioning properly, leading to symptoms such as dizziness, fainting, shortness of breath, and fatigue. The pacemaker helps to regulate the heart rate and ensure that the heart beats at a suitable pace, thereby improving the patient's quality of life and reducing the risk of complications associated with an irregular heart rhythm.
###### **PART 3**
The coronary ostia are the openings for the coronary arteries, located in the aortic sinuses. The right and left coronary arteries arise from the right and left aortic sinuses, respectively. These ostia are situated at the top of the sinuses and act as overflow pipes when the sinuses are full, allowing the coronary arteries to fill during diastole, which nourishes the heart muscle while it is in a relaxed state. During development, the rotation influences the emergence of the right and left coronary arteries. The right coronary artery emerges in front due to the rotation, while the left coronary artery arises to the left and behind.

Coronary artery filling during diastole plays a crucial role in heart muscle nourishment by allowing the heart muscle to be fed with blood while it is in a relaxed state. This ensures that the myocardium, as well as the conducting system, is supplied with oxygenated blood, supporting the heart's overall function. The significant branches supplied by the right coronary artery include the conus arteriosus, the right marginal artery, and the posterior interventricular (posterior descending) artery. The right coronary artery also supplies the sinu-atrial node, the atrioventricular node, and other atrial and ventricular branches. The posterior interventricular artery supplies the posterior part of the interventricular septum and the inferior part of the left ventricle.

The left coronary artery divides into the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and the circumflex artery. The LAD supplies the anterior interventricular septum and the anterior part of both ventricles, while the circumflex artery supplies the left atrium and the lateral wall of the left ventricle. Occlusions in these arteries can have a significant impact on heart function. Since the right coronary artery essentially supplies the "right heart" and the left coronary artery supplies the "left heart," occlusion of either artery can result in necrosis of the territory supplied by that artery. This can lead to myocardial infarction, impaired cardiac function, and potentially life-threatening complications.

The right coronary artery predominantly supplies the right atrium and the majority of the right ventricle, with significant contributions from the right marginal artery and the posterior interventricular artery. The latter also gives a small contribution to the left ventricle. Additionally, the right coronary artery supplies both the sinoatrial (SA) node and the atrioventricular (AV) node.

The left coronary artery predominantly supplies the left ventricle, including the anterior interventricular, left marginal, and left circumflex arteries. The circumflex artery also supplies the left atrium.

Coronary artery dominance refers to which artery supplies the posterior descending artery. If the right coronary artery supplies the posterior descending artery, it is considered right dominant, while if the left circumflex artery supplies it, it is considered left dominant. Variations in coronary artery dominance can affect the heart's function and pose potential risks during surgeries, as the blood supply to different areas of the heart may vary. Surgeons need to be aware of these variations to ensure proper management during procedures such as coronary artery bypass grafting.

The major cardiac veins include the great cardiac vein, the middle cardiac vein, the small cardiac vein, and the coronary sinus. These veins run parallel to the major coronary arteries and drain the myocardium. The great cardiac vein runs alongside the anterior interventricular artery, the middle cardiac vein runs alongside the posterior interventricular artery, and the small cardiac vein runs alongside the right marginal artery. These veins ultimately drain into the coronary sinus, which contributes to venous drainage in the heart.

The coronary sinus plays a crucial role in venous drainage by collecting deoxygenated blood from the myocardium and delivering it to the right atrium. It receives blood from the great cardiac vein, the middle cardiac vein, the small cardiac vein, and several other smaller veins. The coronary sinus is an important structure for the venous return of the heart and is essential for maintaining proper cardiac function.

The clinical significance of these cardiac veins lies in their role in draining deoxygenated blood from the myocardium. Understanding the anatomy and function of these veins is crucial for diagnosing and managing conditions such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, and arrhythmias. Additionally, knowledge of the cardiac venous system is essential for interventional procedures such as cardiac catheterization and pacemaker implantation.

The common sites of coronary artery occlusion are the anterior interventricular (left anterior descending) artery (40-50%), the right coronary artery (30-40%), and the circumflex artery (10-20%). Occlusion occurs due to the build-up of material between the endothelium and tunica media of the blood vessels, forming atheromas that can lead to the clinical condition of arteriosclerosis. This can result in myocardial ischemia, leading to angina pectoris and, in severe cases, a heart attack or myocardial infarction.

Myocardial ischemia, resulting from occlusion of a coronary artery, leads to the manifestation of angina pectoris. When there is a sudden decrease in blood flow to the heart muscle, the heart responds by signaling pain, which is referred to as angina pectoris. This pain is usually felt in the center of the chest and down the medial side of the left arm and forearm. As the pain worsens, it can lead to a heart attack or myocardial infarction.

A heart attack or myocardial infarction occurs when there is a complete blockage of a coronary artery, leading to the death of cardiac muscle due to the loss of its blood supply. This results in the formation of a blood clot or thrombus, ultimately clogging the artery. The death of the cardiac muscle after the loss of its blood supply is known as a myocardial infarction. The visceral sensation is carried back to the T1-T4 regions of the spinal cord, and the brain interprets these incoming pain fibers as originating in the skin, leading to the perception of pain in the chest and left upper forearm. Myocardial infarction can have severe implications, including damage to the heart muscle and potential life-threatening complications.

Coronary angioplasty is a procedure used to relieve blockages in the coronary arteries. It involves the use of a balloon catheter that is guided into position using ultrasound and angiography. Once in place, the balloon is inflated, which compresses the atheromatous plaque against the arterial wall, widening the artery and restoring blood flow. Often, a stent is placed during the procedure to help keep the artery open. This technique is effective in relieving the symptoms of coronary artery disease and reducing the risk of heart attacks.

A coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedure is used to address coronary obstructions by creating new pathways for blood to flow to the heart muscle. During the procedure, a healthy blood vessel is taken from another part of the body, such as the chest, leg, or arm, and is used to bypass the blocked or narrowed section of the coronary artery. This allows blood to flow freely to the heart muscle, bypassing the obstruction and restoring proper blood supply to the heart.

Different graft vessels used in CABG procedures include the internal thoracic artery (also known as the internal mammary artery), the radial artery, and the saphenous vein. The internal thoracic artery is the most commonly used graft vessel due to its long-term patency and superior outcomes. The radial artery and saphenous vein are also used as graft vessels, with the saphenous vein being the most frequently used due to its availability. These graft vessels function by creating a new pathway for blood to flow, bypassing the arterial blockages and restoring blood supply to the heart muscle.

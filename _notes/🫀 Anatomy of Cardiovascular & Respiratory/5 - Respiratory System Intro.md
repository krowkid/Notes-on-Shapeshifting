# Passage
###### **PART 1**

The thoracic cavity contains the lungs covered by visceral pleura. The space between the lungs is known as the mediastinum, housing the heart and major blood vessels. Bounded by the thoracic vertebral column, ribs, and sternum, the thoracic cavity extends from the superior thoracic aperture (thoracic inlet), closed by the suprapleural membrane, to the inferior thoracic aperture, sealed by the diaphragm.

The thoracic inlet comprises a bony ring formed by the first thoracic vertebra, first rib, first costal cartilage, and upper margin of the manubrium. Suspended above by the suprapleural membrane, this inlet allows structures like the trachea and oesophagus to pass through, although they penetrate this membrane. Conversely, the thoracic outlet, enclosed by the costal margin, 11th and 12th ribs, and the 12th thoracic vertebra, is closed off by the diaphragm. It facilitates the passage of structures into the abdomen and permits venous blood return to the heart from the lower body.

Structures passing through the thoracic inlet use different fascial sleeves, such as the pre-tracheal fascia for the trachea and oesophagus, the carotid sheath for head and neck vessels, and the axillary sheath for upper limb vessels. Additionally, thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) results from neurovascular compression at the thoracic inlet, despite historical confusion surrounding its terminology originating from Dr. RM Peet's description in 1956. Causes of TOS include anatomical variations like an extra rib, clavicle fractures, or lung cancer affecting the space for vessels.

Thoracic Outlet Syndrome (TOS) manifests through symptoms like forearm and hand pain, weakness, numbness, tingling, swelling, fatigue, or coldness, resembling other conditions and complicating diagnosis. It results from compression of neurovascular structures—brachial plexus, subclavian artery, and vein—as they exit the thoracic inlet. Neurological symptoms occur in 95% of cases, starting with pain and tingling and progressing to muscle weakness and atrophy, often due to issues with the scalene muscles or compression of the subclavian vein.

TOS leads to various compressions affecting veins, arteries, nerves (such as the phrenic, vagus, sympathetic chain, causing Horner's syndrome), and structures passing through the thoracic outlet (like the brachial plexus, trachea, and oesophagus). The diaphragm, which separates the thorax from the abdomen, marks the true thoracic outlet. Its name, derived from the Greek word for "partition or barrier," highlights its function. Structures transitioning between these regions either pass through or behind this muscle. The periphery of the diaphragm meets the chest wall through the costodiaphragmatic recess or phrenic angle, a narrow gap that lung tissue doesn't fully enter, even during maximal inspiration. Medical procedures often access the pleural cavity through this recess, ensuring minimal risk to lung tissue.

###### **PART 2**
The diaphragm, a sheet of skeletal muscle, comprises a central tendinous portion supporting the heart and a peripheral muscular part, forming two domes—hemi-diaphragms—where the right dome sits higher due to the underlying liver. During breathing, these domes contract, flattening the diaphragm and allowing oxygen intake.

Attachments of the diaphragm involve the thoracic outlet's bony-cartilaginous rim, ascending fibres to the central tendon, and posterior connections to the abdominal wall fascia, vertebral column, and specific muscles like the psoas major and quadratus lumborum. The diaphragm also possesses crura, extensions descending to attach to lumbar vertebrae, aiding its stability.

Several openings within the diaphragm facilitate the passage of major structures. The caval opening permits the inferior vena cava's passage, aiding venous blood return to the heart during inspiration. The aortic opening accommodates the aorta's passage without impeding its function during diaphragmatic contractions. The oesophageal opening, formed by the right crus, allows the oesophagus to pass and acts as a sphincter to prevent reflux during inspiration. Additionally, the diaphragm's inferior surface presents these openings: the caval opening (blue), oesophageal opening (green), and aortic opening (red). Structures passing through these openings include the inferior vena cava, oesophagus, anterior and posterior vagal trunks, aorta, thoracic duct, azygos vein, and sympathetic chains. The caval opening commonly shares space with the right phrenic nerve, while the oesophageal hiatus allows passage not only for the oesophagus but also for vagal trunks and small blood vessels. The aortic opening accommodates the aorta, thoracic duct, azygos vein, and sympathetic chains.

It's commonly asserted that the openings within the diaphragm align with specific vertebral levels—T8 for the caval opening, T10 for the oesophageal opening, and T12 for the aortic opening. However, recent studies reveal significant variability in these positions among individuals, challenging this traditional understanding. The diaphragm's dynamic nature and its variability over time render these fixed vertebral levels inaccurate. Rather than focusing solely on these levels, it's more beneficial to comprehend why structures pass through tendon, muscle, or bypass the diaphragm altogether—a functional perspective that offers a more practical understanding.

The nerve supply to the diaphragm primarily comes from the phrenic nerves, originating from C3 to C5, with C4 being the primary motor supply. These nerves enter the thoracic inlet, passing anterior to the scalenus anterior muscle and along the subclavian artery and vein, subsequently innervating the diaphragm from above and below. Additionally, some lower intercostal nerves contribute sensory fibers to the peripheral diaphragm, but their significance is minimal compared to the phrenic nerves, which exclusively control diaphragmatic movement.

Regarding blood supply, the diaphragm receives arterial supply from various sources, including branches of the internal thoracic arteries (pericardiophrenic, musculophrenic, superior phrenic, and lower posterior intercostal arteries from the thoracic aorta) and the inferior phrenic artery, a branch of the abdominal aorta. Despite this rich blood supply, the loss of any specific artery typically doesn't lead to functional impairment or clinical issues due to the redundancy in the diaphragm's blood supply.

###### **PART 3**
Breathing involves both expiration (breathing out) and inspiration (breathing in). Exhalation occurs when the diaphragm relaxes, allowing it to ascend, and the ribcage depresses. Conversely, inhalation happens when the diaphragm contracts, lifting it and expanding the ribcage. Breathing can be categorised into diaphragmatic (diaphragm movement) and thoracic (ribcage movement). Quiet breathing involves shallow diaphragmatic movement, while forced breathing involves extensive diaphragmatic and ribcage elevation.

Control of breathing resides in the pons and medulla oblongata in the brainstem. The medulla houses the ventral and dorsal respiratory groups, with the pre-Bötzinger complex setting the breathing rhythm, while the pontine centres, including the pneumotaxic and apneustic centres, coordinate and modulate the medullary activity. The pre-Bötzinger complex orchestrates the breathing rhythm, with the ventral group regulating inhalation and exhalation force. The dorsal group focuses on stimulating inspiratory muscles and remains less active during expiration. The pneumotaxic centre coordinates and fine-tunes the medullary groups, while the apneustic centre stimulates inspiration but is inhibited by the pneumotaxic centre to control breathing speed.

These respiratory nuclei's actions are complex and influenced by sensory feedback. However, discussing their full intricacies is beyond the scope here, best left to physiologists. Gas exchange in the respiratory system transports oxygen to body tissues and eliminates hydrogen ions. Within the lungs, hydrogen combines with bicarbonate from metabolism, producing carbon dioxide and water. While water is retained, carbon dioxide is eliminated through exhalation. The lungs, vital for gas exchange, rely on pressure changes in the chest cavity for inhalation and exhalation. The thoracic cavity, encompassed by the ribcage, diaphragm, and suprapleural membrane, houses the lungs and mediastinum, where central structures like the heart, great vessels, oesophagus, and trachea reside.

Pleural membranes, namely the parietal and visceral pleurae, cloak the lung's boundaries and inner surface, respectively. The parietal pleura covers the ribcage, diaphragm, suprapleural membrane, and mediastinum, while the visceral pleura encases the lung. These membranes enclose a minute pleural cavity, secreting fluid between them. Changes in this cavity's pressure facilitate breathing: when the cavity's pressure drops due to rib or diaphragm movement, the visceral pleura is pulled towards the parietal pleura, causing the lungs, tethered to the visceral pleura, to inflate and draw air.

The diaphragm, a crucial player in breathing, contracts and flattens when engaged, acting as bellows to inflate the lungs. Similar to a bellows—a tool pushing air into a fire—the diaphragm's contraction lowers its domes, inflating the lungs, while its relaxation elevates, deflating the lungs and expelling air. The rib cage functions akin to the other part of the bellows, aiding in this inflation and deflation process. This mechanism demonstrates how the movement of the parietal pleura, primarily triggered by the diaphragm's action, drives inhalation and exhalation, mimicking the function of bellows in drawing air into the lungs and expelling it out.

The pleural membranes play a vital role in respiratory mechanics. Let's dive into this intriguing anatomical arrangement!

The thoracic wall, enveloped by the endothoracic fascia, is sheathed in parietal pleura, distinguishing areas like the costal pleura (inside the ribcage, marked in green), cervical pleura (reaching into the neck under the suprapleural membrane), diaphragmatic pleura (covering the diaphragm's upper surface in light blue), and mediastinal pleura (in dark blue), which allows passage for airways, vessels, and nerves to enter and exit the lung. Sensitivity varies across these pleural regions. The costal and cervical pleura receive sensation from the intercostal nerves, while the diaphragmatic and mediastinal pleura are innervated by the phrenic nerves (C3-C5). Inflammation of the pleura, termed pleurisy, triggers pain transmitted through these nerves. Stimulation of intercostal nerves elicits localized pain, whereas phrenic nerve stimulation induces shoulder pain due to the location of the C3-C5 dermatomes.

The pleural cavity, housing both parietal and visceral pleurae, sustains negative pressure (around -4 mmHg or 0.5 kPa) due to the elastic fibers within the lung tissue, consistently pulling the lung's visceral pleura inwards. During inspiration, as the thoracic cavity expands, intrapleural pressure temporarily drops to around -6 mmHg before the lungs move closer to the parietal pleura.

Surfactant, a lipoprotein produced by type II pneumocytes lining the lung's alveoli, reduces surface tension within the alveoli, crucial for overcoming resistance to expansion. Without surfactant—absent in premature babies—lung inflation may be compromised. Damage or perforation of pleural membranes, leading to air entering the pleural cavity (pneumothorax), mirrors the barman needing a bit of air between glasses to separate them. Lung collapse occurs due to the lungs' elastic recoil.

Emphysema, a type of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), manifests as alveolar damage and enlarged air spaces within lung tissue, accompanied by the destruction of elastic lung tissue. Typically triggered by smoking, it can also result from asthma, tuberculosis, allergies, infections, or a deficiency in the alpha 1-antitrypsin protein.

In emphysema, reduced lung elasticity causes hyperinflation. The outward pull from the chest wall and diaphragm exceeds the inward pull of the lungs, resulting in a lung that's already maximally inflated at rest (end of expiration). Further inflation becomes challenging, leading to laborious breathing—where the diaphragm descends towards the abdominal cavity, and the chest wall reaches its maximum expansion. In severe cases, the lack of additional space for maneuvering leads to high mortality rates.

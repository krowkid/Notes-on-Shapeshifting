# Passage
###### **PART 1**
The mediastinum refers to the space between the lungs in the thoracic cavity. It's divided into superior and inferior parts by an imaginary plane at the sternal angle. The inferior mediastinum is further split into anterior, middle, and posterior sections, with the heart and pericardium situated in the middle portion. The superior mediastinum, located behind the sternum's manubrium, is often examined through axial scans like CT or MRI due to its position. An understanding of its cross-sectional anatomy is valuable.

Cutting through the T3 vertebra, the superior mediastinum's section includes the sternum, 1st costal cartilages, and the thymus gland, followed by great veins, aortic arch branches, trachea, oesophagus, and the thoracic duct. Nerves like the phrenic and vagus nerves, with their recurrent laryngeal branches, traverse this space. Additionally, the sympathetic chain on each side, lying beyond the vertebral body, is considered outside the superior mediastinum technically.

In an MRI section of the superior mediastinum, bones and blood vessels appear white while air shows up as black. Identifying three arterial branches from the arch and locating veins like the left brachiocephalic vein might not be evident in this view. The trachea, oesophagus, and lungs, containing air, appear black, though the oesophagus's muscular wall remains visible.

The thymus gland primarily resides in the superior mediastinum but can extend into the anterior mediastinum in front of the heart. Functionally, it plays a vital role in the immune system's development, particularly in the origin of T-cell lymphocyte populations. In neonates, the thymus gland is substantial and continues growing until around the age of 1. It maintains a steady size until puberty, after which it regresses, gradually replaced by fat. While crucial in early life to prevent immune disorders, it becomes non-essential after puberty.

The thymus can enlarge due to conditions like myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disease affecting the neuromuscular junction. In X-rays of infants, an enlarged thymus can dominate the chest shadow, often mistaken for an abnormal heart shadow or lung collapse. Behind the thymus lie major veins that eventually merge to form the superior vena cava, entering the heart's right atrium. The internal jugular veins drain the head and neck, merging with venous drainage from the upper limbs—the right and left subclavian veins—to form the brachiocephalic veins. These, in turn, combine to form the superior vena cava.

Behind the veins, within the superior mediastinum, lies the arch of the aorta and its branches—the brachiocephalic trunk, the left common carotid artery, and the left subclavian artery. These arteries follow the path behind the trachea.

###### **PART 2**
The inferior mediastinum spans from the sternal angle's plane to the diaphragm, with the heart dominating the middle portion. The pericardial layers, phrenic nerves, and minimal content like the internal thoracic vessels, lymphatics, and part of the thymus gland reside in the anterior mediastinum. Meanwhile, the posterior mediastinum houses the oesophagus, vagus nerves, azygos veins, descending thoracic aorta, and the sympathetic chain. In this view, the heart's chambers are distinguishable—the right ventricle is in front, the left atrium is behind, and the left ventricular wall is about three times thicker than the right. The aorta veers slightly to the left, becoming more central towards the lower part of the inferior mediastinum. The oesophagus lies behind the left atrium, and the azygos vein is slightly to the right.

The oesophagus, a significant organ in the posterior mediastinum, initially aligns behind the trachea in the superior mediastinum but shifts leftward towards the sternal angle's plane. Passing behind the left main bronchus as it enters the posterior mediastinum, it subsequently moves anterior to the aorta as it descends. Eventually, it penetrates the left muscular hemi-diaphragm, reaching the abdominal region to connect with the stomach. In a cross-sectional view at the T4 vertebra level, the arch of the aorta, superior vena cava, and the projecting arch of the azygos vein are identifiable. While the schematic diagram shows the trachea and oesophagus in the midline, the right-hand diagram depicts the oesophagus deviating towards the left.

The oesophagus closely follows the vertebral column in the mediastinum, showing constrictions caused by adjacent structures. This narrowing is seen in X-rays with barium sulphate highlighting the oesophagus. Notable constrictions occur: firstly, behind the cricoid cartilage at the 6th cervical vertebra; then, the arch of the aorta causes constriction at point A, the left main bronchus at B, the left atrium at C, and finally, passage through the diaphragm at D. Enlargements of these structures can further compress the oesophagus, leading to swallowing difficulties (dysphagia). Additionally, deliberate compression at point E, pressing the cricoid, may prevent unconscious patients from vomiting and inhaling vomit, averting suffocation.

The oesophagus receives nerve supply via vagus branches, controlling smooth muscle in its lower part. The upper section, consisting of skeletal muscle, is also innervated by the vagus nerves.

In the posterior mediastinum, the azygos vein receives blood from the posterior chest wall, with some drainage to the internal and lateral thoracic veins. The hemiazygos and accessory hemiazygos veins handle drainage from specific areas of the left thoracic cage, eventually joining the azygos vein at various levels. The azygos vein drains the entire right side of the posterior chest, except for the 1st posterior intercostal vein, which drains into the right brachiocephalic vein. It merges with the superior vena cava at the sternal angle's plane. Blockages in the azygos vein cause reverse blood flow towards the tributaries of the inferior vena cava due to its lack of valves. Infections can easily spread along these veins from the chest to the vertebral column and onwards to the brain.

In the posterior mediastinum, the aorta supplies blood to the posterior chest wall through the posterior intercostal arteries. It also provides visceral branches to the lungs, specifically the bronchial arteries for the respiratory tract's conduction part, and branches to the oesophagus, usually 2 or 3 oesophageal arteries. Additionally, there are a few other mediastinal branches from the aorta.

Regarding the thoracic duct, the lecture refers to prior discussions on the lymphatic system of the chest and the thoracic duct itself. Originating at the upper end of the cisterna chyli near T12's upper border, it enters the thorax through the aortic opening, traversing the posterior mediastinum behind the oesophagus. At the sternal angle's plane, it veers leftward, terminating at the root of the neck by joining the left subclavian vein and left internal jugular vein.

###### **PART 3**
The chest harbours three primary pairs of nerves. The phrenic nerves, foremost in position, govern diaphragmatic motor control, with additional functions. Originating from C3-5, they course down in front of the subclavian artery at the thoracic inlet and lie anteriorly to the lung root within the chest.

Near the thoracic inlet, the vagus nerves (Xth cranial nerves) reside in close proximity to the phrenic nerves. These nerves, encompassing somatic and autonomic components, serve diverse functions across the head, neck, thorax, and abdomen. Named "vagus" from Latin, signifying "the wanderer," these nerves intricately associate with the oesophagus and traverse behind the lung root within the chest.

At the posterior aspect of the thoracic inlet and chest are the sympathetic chains, positioned along the ribs' necks. Considering each nerve's origin, course, relations, and target organs/function is imperative.

To recap, the phrenic nerves arise from C3-C5, while the vagus nerves originate from the brainstem as the tenth cranial nerve. Both pairs descend through the neck, with the phrenic nerves coursing anterior to the scalenus anterior muscles, moving between the subclavian arteries and veins into the chest through the thoracic inlet. Meanwhile, the vagus nerves are sandwiched between the common carotid arteries and internal jugular veins in the neck. The left vagus enters the thoracic inlet between the left common carotid and left subclavian arteries, positioned posteriorly to the left brachiocephalic vein. The right vagus travels downwards posterior to the right brachiocephalic vein and superior vena cava, before entering the chest through the thoracic inlet.

The phrenic nerves, controlled by the respiratory centres in the hindbrain, manage the rhythmic breathing pattern. Interruption of neurons in the hindbrain or spinal cord above C3 level can disrupt breathing.

The right phrenic nerve courses alongside the superior vena cava, crossing anteriorly to the lung root and traversing over the right heart border. It then penetrates the diaphragm beside the inferior vena cava, supplying the diaphragm from below. Similarly, the left phrenic nerve associates with the pulmonary trunk, aorta, and the left heart border before piercing the muscular part of the left diaphragm dome.

These nerves also provide sensory innervation to the adjacent thoracic and abdominal parietal serosa. Irritation can cause shoulder pain through the C3-5 dermatomes.

Vagus nerves control the upper airways, functioning in both motor and sensory capacities. They branch in the neck, including cardiac branches. The superior laryngeal branch, responsible for sensory perception above the vocal cords, initiates the cough reflex. Additionally, cardiac branches originating in the neck supply the heart, maintaining a tonic inhibitory state—increased stimulation further slows the heart rate.

In the superior mediastinum, the vagus nerves run posteriorly to the lung roots. Branches extend to the tracheal bifurcation via the pulmonary plexus and to the aortic arch via the cardiac plexus, destined to supply the heart and lungs.

In the superior mediastinum, the vagus nerves lie anterior to the subclavian arteries and target the oesophagus in the inferior mediastinum. Along their path, recurrent laryngeal branches supply most laryngeal muscles (except one) and offer sensory input to the lower larynx and trachea. The right recurrent laryngeal nerve loops around the right subclavian artery, while the left one loops around the aortic arch. As they encircle the oesophagus, they provide sensory and motor fibres via the oesophageal plexus. The left vagus forms the anterior vagal trunk, while the right vagus forms the posterior vagal trunk, with their branches freely anastomosing.

Regarding sympathetic nerves in the chest, they target various chest organs including the heart and lungs. Their role in the oesophagus remains unclear, but they diminish secretions from the oesophageal wall. Sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves combine to form plexuses like the cardiac, pulmonary, and oesophageal plexuses.

The cardiac plexus supplies the heart, comprising a sympathetic network around the aortic arch, pulmonary artery, and left and right coronary arteries. Both atria and ventricles receive innervation from this plexus. The cardiac fibres originate from the upper thoracic spinal segments, with many preganglionic fibres synapsing in the T1-T4 ganglia. Some ascend in the cervical sympathetic chain to synapse in cervical ganglia before descending to the cardiac plexus.

Afferent fibres from the heart follow a course similar to sympathetic fibres, entering the T1-T4 spinal segments, particularly on the left side. This visceral afferent input correlates with somatic sensory input in the same spinal cord segments. Pain originating from the cardiac afferents (e.g., during a heart attack) might be confused with somatic afferent pain, resulting in referred pain. In cases of cardiac pain, discomfort is felt over the distribution of the T1-T4 somatic fibres on the left side, extending into the neck's root.

The heart's parasympathetic supply is through the vagus nerves, which decrease heart rate.

For the lungs, there exists a pulmonary plexus. Sympathetic innervation ranges from T1-T5 (though T5 varies) and results in increased smooth muscle tone in lung blood vessels, causing vasoconstriction. Conversely, parasympathetic input from the vagus induces bronchoconstriction and heightens bronchial secretion in the respiratory tract.

Additionally, an oesophageal plexus, mainly with sympathetics from T2-T6 (though highly variable), is present. Activation of the sympathetic nervous system inhibits secretions from the oesophageal glands. Meanwhile, the parasympathetic element to the oesophagus, primarily from the vagus, acts as a motor supply. Sensory nerves of the oesophagus also utilise the vagus for transmission.

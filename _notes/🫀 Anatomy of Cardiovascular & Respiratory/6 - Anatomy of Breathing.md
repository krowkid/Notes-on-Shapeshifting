###### **PART 1**
The mechanisms behind breathing, specifically thoracic and diaphragmatic breathing, play pivotal roles in our respiratory process. Understanding these movements aids in comprehending how inhalation and exhalation occur. Diaphragmatic breathing involves the movement of the diaphragm, while thoracic breathing involves the chest wall. The distinctions lie in the extent of movement during breathing: quiet breathing involves minimal diaphragm movement, while forced breathing requires more substantial diaphragm and ribcage movements. The contraction of the diaphragm and elevation of the chest during inhalation expand the thoracic cavity and, consequently, the lungs. As the thoracic cavity expands, pressure decreases, causing air to rush in due to the movement from high to low pressure areas. This process is inhalation or inspiration.

Conversely, during exhalation or expiration, the diaphragm elevates, the ribcage depresses, and the volume decreases, creating higher pressure within the chest, leading to air being expelled from the lungs. The diaphragm's attachments are crucial for its function. It connects to the boundaries of the thoracic outlet, with the domes of the diaphragm rising to the 4th rib on the right and the 5th intercostal space on the left during quiet breathing. However, during forced breathing, the ascending ribs could conflict with the descending diaphragm. To counter this, the 12th rib is held down, preventing the diaphragm from ascending with the ribcage. The prevention of diaphragm ascent with the ribcage is facilitated by the contraction of the quadratus lumborum muscle. This muscle attaches to the iliac crest of the hip bones below and the 12th rib above. Although it arises from various points, its key attachment crucial for this purpose is the iliac crest. Innervated by the anterior rami of T12-L3, the quadratus lumborum aids in maintaining the diaphragm's position during forced breathing, ensuring efficient respiratory function.

In normal, unforced breathing, the rib cage usually undergoes minimal movement. Instead, the diaphragm's descent facilitates the necessary expansion of the thoracic cavity for inspiration. When in an upright position, gravity aids this process by causing the abdominal organs, notably the liver, to descend. This descent assists the diaphragm's movement, enabling the expansion of the thoracic cavity required for inhalation. Simultaneously, the abdominal wall reflexively relaxes, accommodating the displacement of abdominal organs. Conversely, during exhalation, the abdominal wall reflexively contracts, pushing the abdominal organs and diaphragm upwards—a process known as the thoraco-abdominal pump or abdominal breathing.

However, when lying down, gravity has a contrasting effect on breathing. The liver moves upwards towards the chest due to the vertebral column's curve, creating an uphill movement for the liver. The weight of the liver, approximately 1500g, heavily influences this movement. This gravitational shift impedes respiratory function, and individuals experiencing respiratory stress often prefer to avoid lying down due to this discomforting effect. Posture significantly impacts the ability to elevate the ribcage against gravity. A straight back maximizes the ribs' ability to elevate, enhancing their contribution to breathing. Conversely, a slouched posture limits rib movement by bringing them closer together and in a more oblique orientation, restricting abdominal expansion.

The optimal position for breathing efficiency involves propping oneself up at a 45-degree angle either backward (the Fowler position) or forward. However, forward positioning, despite aiding comfort for some patients, involves vertebral column flexion, which is not ideal. Others find 45-degree elevation on their sides more comfortable, offering an alternative positioning option.

The muscles attached to the thoracic inlet play a crucial role in supporting the chest wall against the downward forces of gravity, aiding the actions of breathing muscles and, when necessary, elevating the chest wall during forced breathing. One of the prominent muscles in this region is the sternocleidomastoid, its name reflects its attachments: "sterno" from sternum, "cleido" from clavicle, and "mastoid" from the mastoid process of the skull. This versatile muscle enables the turning of the head to the side and, in conjunction with its partner on the opposite side, allows for forward pulling and backward tilting of the head, such as when peering over someone's shoulder. Interestingly, when the head is stable, this muscle assists in elevating the sternum. It primarily functions under the control of the spinal accessory nerve (CN XI).

The second group of muscles worth considering is the scalene muscles, which consist of the scalenus anterior, medius, and posterior. These muscles collectively attach proximally to the cervical vertebrae and distally to the first (anterior and medius) and second (posterior) ribs. Their role involves elevating these ribs when the neck is stable, aiding in chest wall elevation during specific breathing actions. Innervated by nerves of the cervical plexus, the scalene muscles contribute to respiratory functions as inspiratory muscles.

Both the sternocleidomastoid and scalene muscles support the chest wall against gravity's pull, assisting in stabilizing and facilitating breathing actions. While their primary functions relate to head and neck movement, these muscles showcase their significance in forced breathing situations when maximal effort is required to elevate the chest wall and aid in inhalation. Understanding their anatomical attachments and functional roles provides insight into their contribution to both respiratory and musculoskeletal dynamics.
###### **PART 2**
The direction of muscle fibres within the chest wall's intercostal spaces provides insight into their respective functions. The external intercostal muscle, visible beneath the skin and fascia between the ribs, exhibits fibres oriented forwards and downwards. This particular orientation hints at its primary function. The intercostal muscles are arranged in three layers: external, internal, and innermost. Nestled between these layers lies the neurovascular bundle, responsible for innervating these muscles. Notably, these nerves also supply sensory input to the skin, superficial fascia, and parietal pleura, conveying sensations like pain.

The external intercostal muscle doesn't uniformly occupy the intercostal space. There exists a gap at the front, filled by the surrounding fascial epimysium but devoid of muscle fibres—a region referred to as the external intercostal membrane. Similarly, the internal intercostal muscle layer features a membrane at the back of the intercostal space. Moving deeper, the innermost intercostal muscle layer resembles the internal intercostal muscle in appearance, often fusing with it. However, unlike the internal layer, its muscle fibres may span multiple intercostal spaces. This layer may lack completeness but exhibits thickenings anteriorly (forming the transversus thoracis muscle or triangularis sternae) and posteriorly (termed subcostal muscles or infracostalis). These descriptions suggest a pattern of transverse muscle fibres within this layer.

Despite the complex nomenclature—multiple names attributed to these muscles—they primarily function as weak expiratory muscles. This revelation contrasts with the expectation of their significance based on their multiple designations, revealing their role primarily in aiding expiration rather than being powerful respiratory contributors.

The intercostal muscles, crucial for stabilizing the intercostal spaces during respiration, prevent their excessive inward or outward movement that could hinder the necessary thoracic volume changes during breathing. These muscles play a vital role in both inspiration and expiration phases, contributing to the rigidity of the spaces and facilitating optimal thoracic volume alterations. The external intercostal muscles aid inspiration by assisting in expanding the thoracic cavity during breathing. Conversely, the innermost intercostal muscles are believed to primarily aid in expiration. Yet, the internal intercostal muscle layer, positioned between these two, exhibits fibres running in a backward and downward direction—opposite to the external intercostal muscles. This contradictory orientation raises questions about its function.

Some argue that the internal intercostal muscles could function both inspiratorily and expiratorily simultaneously, though it's a complex phenomenon. Experimental evidence struggles to isolate these muscle layers, making it challenging to determine their specific roles. While electrical activity in intercostal muscles is recorded during both inspiration and expiration, classifying them as purely inspiratory or expiratory relies on their rib movement. The fixed positions of certain ribs by other muscles, such as the first rib held static by the scalene muscles and the 12th rib fixed by the quadratus lumborum muscle, further complicate this understanding. This leads to speculation that the internal intercostal muscles might serve to either elevate or depress the ribs, depending on their action.

Research suggests that the inter-chondral portion of the internal intercostal muscle layer, where external intercostal fibres are absent, predominantly contracts during inspiration rather than expiration, indicating an inspiratory role for this specific region. Conclusively, recent literature concludes that both the external intercostal muscle layer and the inter-chondral portion of the internal intercostal muscle layer function as inspiratory muscles. However, the intercostal portion of the internal intercostal muscle is predominantly involved in aiding expiration.

Studies illustrate that as the distance from the costovertebral joint increases, the effects of the external and internal intercostal muscles shift. At the back of the intercostal space, the external intercostal muscles primarily aid in inspiration, while the internal intercostal muscles support expiration. However, this dynamic changes as the muscles approach the sternum, indicated by the angle theta in the diagram. Beyond 120 degrees, there's a reversal: the internal intercostal muscles become inspiratory while the external intercostal muscles adopt an expiratory role. It's important to note that these changes in function can vary across different intercostal spaces.
###### **PART 3**
The phenomenon of a flail chest emerges from the traumatic fracturing of multiple ribs, causing the intercostal muscles to lose their capacity to stabilize the chest wall during breathing. This condition, marked by the inward collapse of the chest during inhalation and outward expansion during exhalation, constitutes a medical emergency known as a "flail chest." Characterized by paradoxical rib movements, this condition showcases an isolated segment of the rib cage moving in the opposite direction to the rest of the ribs. Prompt intervention is crucial, typically involving the placement of a firm pack over the affected segment to restrict movement until surgical measures can be taken.

Breathing mechanics play a pivotal role in understanding this condition. In the act of breathing, the diaphragm descends during inhalation, while forced breathing raises and expands the chest, augmenting its volume and decreasing internal pressure. This alteration causes the flail segment to retract during inhalation and protrude during exhalation, contrary to the natural movement of the chest wall—thus termed paradoxical chest movement.

Delving into the mechanics of respiratory support during physical exertion, such as observed in runners, sheds light on the engagement of accessory muscles to optimize breathing. Notably, the muscles at the forefront of the chest, including the pectoralis major and minor, come into play. The pectoralis minor, situated beneath the major muscle, attaches to ribs 3-5, originating from the coracoid process of the scapula. Its action involves elevating these ribs. On the other hand, the pectoralis major, with a broad proximal attachment and distal connection to the humerus bone, contributes to the elevation of the rib cage, particularly via its lower fibers linked to the 5th and 6th costal cartilages and costal margin.

Observations of runners bending over and clutching their knees post-race highlight a deliberate use of these accessory muscles. By stabilizing the upper limbs and contracting the pectoral muscles, runners elevate the ribcage, enabling a firmer grip on their knees. Furthermore, the act of bending mitigates the gravitational pull on the chest wall, aiding in reducing its descent.

The serratus anterior muscle, connected to the upper eight ribs laterally and inserting into the scapula's medial border, stands as another upper limb muscle pertinent to breathing mechanics. Known for its serrated appearance, especially in well-built individuals, its primary function involves pulling the scapula forward against the chest wall, as often seen in actions like throwing a punch. However, if the scapula remains fixed, the lower portion of this muscle can aid in lifting the rib cage, thus supporting inspiratory movements. When it comes to expiratory actions, while the predominant mechanisms involve gravity and the elastic recoil of the lungs, instances requiring rapid expiration, such as during coughing, demand muscular effort. Key contributors to forceful expiration include the anterior abdominal wall muscles, primarily the rectus abdominis and external oblique abdominis. Their contraction pulls the ribs downwards, facilitating exhalation. Additionally, the transversus abdominis compresses the abdominal cavity, assisting in elevating the relaxed diaphragm towards the thoracic cavity, thereby aiding forceful expiration.

Exploring the serratus posterior muscles, comprising the superior and inferior ones, reveals interesting anatomical attachments. The superior serratus posterior muscle originates from the spinous processes and supraspinous ligaments of C7-T2, inserting onto ribs 2-5. Conversely, the inferior serratus posterior muscle arises from the spinous processes and supraspinous ligaments of T11-L2, inserting onto ribs 9-12. While textbooks often label these muscles as inspiratory and expiratory respectively based on their attachments, electromyographic studies indicate their inactivity during breathing, even in cases of obstructive lung disease. Contrary to the assumption of their involvement in respiratory actions, these muscles seemingly play a role in gauging stresses along the thoracic spine, functioning proprioceptively for the vertebral column. Consequently, they are excluded from discussions surrounding respiration due to their non-participation in breathing processes, despite their seemingly suggestive attachments.

The levator costarum muscles, intimately linked to the thoracic section of the vertebral column, exist in two variants—a longer and a shorter version—both innervated by dorsal rami of segmental nerves. Originating from the transverse processes of C7 to T11, the levator costarum brevis inserts onto the rib directly below its originating vertebra, while the levator costarum longus attaches to the rib two levels below its point of origin. Despite their primary function being rib elevation, their proximity to the joints they affect renders them weak and insignificant contributors to respiratory actions due to their size and limited strength.

In the realm of respiratory muscles, the orchestrated action during forced inspiration involves a series of muscle groups. The scalene muscles secure the stability of the first two ribs, while the sternocleidomastoid muscle aids in stabilizing the sternum. The external intercostal muscles, alongside the interchondral section of the internal intercostal muscles, participate in elevating the ribs. Simultaneously, the diaphragm contracts forcefully, orchestrating the primary action of inspiration. Notably, accessory muscles like the pectoralis minor, alongside the pivotal roles played by the pectoralis major and serratus anterior, contribute significantly to this process, albeit not explicitly depicted in some illustrations.

In contrast, quiet expiration necessitates merely the relaxation of inspiratory muscles. The ribcage descends, the diaphragm ascends, and the lungs deflate passively. Minimal contraction of the intercostal muscles becomes crucial to prevent the flaring out of the intercostal spaces. However, during forced breathing, the intercostal section of the internal intercostal muscle likely aids in depressing the ribs, while overall intercostal muscle contraction is essential to avert excessive expansion. Additionally, the abdominal muscles contract, depressing the ribcage and compressing the abdominal cavity, aiding the diaphragm's return to its resting position and facilitating the expiratory phase.

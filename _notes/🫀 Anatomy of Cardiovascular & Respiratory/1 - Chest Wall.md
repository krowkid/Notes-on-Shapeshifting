###### **PART 1**
The basic structure of the chest wall includes the sternum, ribs, intercostal spaces, and thoracic vertebrae. The sternum is a flat bone located in the center of the chest. The ribs are curved bones that attach to the sternum at the front of the chest and to the thoracic vertebrae at the back. The intercostal spaces are the spaces between the ribs. The thoracic vertebrae are the bones of the spine that are located in the chest region. 

The thoracic cage, also known as the chest, is a vital structure that protects the organs within the thoracic cavity, such as the heart and lungs. There are several terms commonly used to describe the components and characteristics of the thoracic cage. Firstly, the sternum is a flat bone located in the center of the chest. It consists of three parts: the manubrium, the body, and the xiphoid process. The sternum serves as an attachment point for the ribs and plays a crucial role in the stability and structure of the chest. The sternum has three parts: the manubrium, the body, and the xiphisternum (or xiphoid process). The manubrium is the handle of the dagger and is connected to the body and xiphisternum by secondary cartilaginous joints. The body is the main part of the sternum, and the xiphisternum is a sharp point or sword. These parts are linked together and form the structure of the sternum.

Secondly, the ribs are curved bones that attach to the sternum at the front of the chest and to the thoracic vertebrae at the back. There are twelve pairs of ribs, and they are classified into three types: true ribs, false ribs, and floating ribs. True ribs (ribs 1-7) attach directly to the sternum, false ribs (ribs 8-10) attach to the cartilage of the rib above, and floating ribs (ribs 11-12) do not attach to the sternum at all. 

The intercostal spaces are the spaces between the ribs. They are filled with intercostal muscles, blood vessels, and nerves. These spaces allow for expansion and contraction of the chest during breathing. Lastly, the thoracic vertebrae are the bones of the spine that are located in the chest region. There are twelve thoracic vertebrae, corresponding to the twelve pairs of ribs. These vertebrae provide support and protection to the spinal cord and play a role in the overall structure and movement of the chest.

The different parts of a rib include the head, neck, tubercle, angle, and shaft. The head of the rib has two articular facets, which allow it to articulate with its corresponding vertebra and the vertebra above. The neck is located distal to the head, followed by the tubercle, which has both an articular part and a non-articular part. The articular part forms a facet joint with the transverse process of the corresponding vertebra, while the non-articular part attaches ligaments that help stabilize the joint. The shaft of the rib bends sharply at the angle, which marks the boundary of the back. The shaft also has a groove inferiorly to accommodate the neurovascular bundle. The shaft continues anteriorly and becomes continuous with the costal cartilage.

Typical ribs are ribs 3-9 (and possibly 10) and have all the aforementioned parts. They have a head with two articular facets, a neck, a tubercle with both articular and non-articular parts, an angle, and a shaft with a groove for the neurovascular bundle. Atypical ribs, on the other hand, do not have all the features of a typical rib or have additional features. The first rib is flatter than other ribs and has grooves and tubercles not seen on the others. It has a single facet on its head, as it only articulates with the T1 vertebra. The second rib has tubercles for the attachment of the scalene muscles and two facets on its head. The tenth rib may occasionally only articulate with the T10 vertebra. The eleventh and twelfth ribs do not have tubercles and have no anterior attachments. They only have a single facet on their head, as they only articulate with their own vertebrae.

###### **PART 2**
The typical thoracic vertebrae are T2-T9. These vertebrae have certain characteristic features, such as the presence of superior and inferior costal facets on their bodies for articulation with the heads of the corresponding ribs. They also have transverse processes with costal facets for articulation with the tubercles of the ribs. The typical thoracic vertebrae play a key role in the structure and movement of the chest. The atypical thoracic vertebrae are T1, T10, T11, and T12. These vertebrae have unique features that distinguish them from the typical vertebrae. For example, T1 has a single facet on its body for articulation with the first rib. T10 is always considered atypical because it only has one demi-facet on its body. Ribs 11 and 12 lack a costotransverse joint and do not have tubercles or anterior attachments.

The thoracic cage features several key joints that facilitate its structural and functional integrity. These include: Sternocostal Joints establish connections between the sternum and the costal cartilages of the ribs. Notably, the initial sternocostal joint represents a primary cartilaginous joint, while the subsequent second to seventh sternocostal joints are categorized as synovial joints. Costovertebral Joints form at the juncture of the rib heads and the vertebral bodies. They serve as synovial joints and play a pivotal role in enabling the ribs to move during the respiratory process. Costotransverse Joints take shape between the tubercles of the ribs and the transverse processes of the thoracic vertebrae. They, too, are synovial joints and contribute significantly to the mobility of the ribs. Interchondral Joints (or Chondrochondral Joints) emerge between the cartilages of the eighth, ninth, and tenth ribs. They are classified as synovial joints and allow for subtle movements between the ribs.

The chest has a complex arrangement of blood vessels, lymphatics, and innervation. The blood supply to the chest wall comes from multiple sources. The pectoral region receives a blood supply from branches of the axillary artery. The front of the chest is supplied by the internal thoracic arteries, while the thoracic aorta gives rise to the posterior intercostal arteries. These arteries anastomose with each other within the intercostal spaces. The lymphatic drainage of the chest is divided into anterior and posterior sets. The anterior set includes the internal thoracic nodes, brachiocephalic nodes, and tracheobronchial nodes, which ultimately drain into the bronchomediastinal lymph trunk. The posterior set includes the posterior intercostal nodes and posterior mediastinal nodes, which drain into the thoracic duct. There are interconnections between these sets, allowing for the spread of infection and cancer between different territories.

The innervation of the chest wall is provided by the intercostal nerves, which are the anterior rami of the thoracic spinal nerves. The posterior rami supply the post-vertebral muscles and the skin overlying them, while the anterior rami supply the intrinsic muscles of the chest (intercostal muscles) and the associated skin. The intercostal nerves also supply the parietal serous membrane surrounding the inside of the chest wall.

The rib cage differs significantly between adults and children due to distinct anatomical and developmental characteristics. Children have a more rounded and flexible rib cage, allowing for greater expansion during breathing, crucial for their growth. Additionally, children's ribs contain a higher proportion of cartilage due to ongoing ossification, making them more pliable. Children also have smaller and narrower rib cages that gradually expand as they develop. The angle at which the ribs attach to the thoracic vertebrae varies, with children having a more horizontal orientation and adults a more oblique one, reflecting growth and maturation.

There are two mechanisms for increasing the thoracic cavity during inspiration: the pump-handle mechanism and the bucket-handle mechanism. The pump-handle mechanism refers to the upward and forward movement of the upper ribs, which increases the antero-posterior diameter of the thoracic cavity. This movement is likened to the action of a pump handle, drawing water up from a well. The bucket-handle mechanism involves the lifting of the lower ribs outwards to the sides, increasing the transverse diameter of the thorax. This movement is compared to the action of a bucket handle being lifted. These mechanisms work together to expand the thoracic cavity and allow for effective gas exchange during inspiration.
###### **PART 3**

The Internal Thoracic (Mammary) Vessels have vital roles in the circulatory system. They supply blood to the pectoral region, including chest wall muscles and tissues, ensuring their nourishment and oxygenation. These vessels also give rise to anterior intercostal arteries, providing blood to the muscles and tissues in the anterior chest. Moreover, internal thoracic veins facilitate the drainage of blood from the chest wall, ultimately connecting with the brachiocephalic veins at the neck's base. The Azygos Venous System contributes to the circulatory system in several vital ways. It primarily drains the posterior part of the thoracic wall, receiving blood from the posterior intercostal veins and other tributaries, thus aiding in deoxygenated blood drainage and its return to the superior vena cava. Additionally, it functions as a critical collateral pathway in cases of vena cava obstruction, ensuring an alternative route for blood to bypass the obstruction and continue flowing towards the heart. Moreover, the azygos vein connects the systemic venous system (superior vena cava) with the portal venous system, allowing for the exchange of blood between the two systems.

The role of the superficial lymphatics of the chest is to drain lymph fluid from the skin and superficial tissues of the chest region. These lymphatics collect the excess fluid, waste products, and immune cells from the tissues and transport them to the regional lymph nodes for filtration and immune response.

Lymphovenous portals are specialized connections between lymphatic vessels and veins. These portals allow for the direct transfer of lymph fluid into the venous system. The importance of lymphovenous portals lies in their role in maintaining fluid balance and immune function. They help to return the filtered lymph fluid back into the bloodstream, ensuring proper circulation and preventing the accumulation of excess fluid in the tissues. Additionally, lymphovenous portals facilitate the transport of immune cells and antigens from the lymphatic system to the bloodstream, contributing to immune surveillance and response.

The deep lymphatics of the chest drain lymph fluid from the deeper structures, such as the lungs, heart, and mediastinum. They play a crucial role in the immune response by filtering and transporting lymph fluid, waste products, and immune cells to the regional lymph nodes for further processing and immune defense. The nerve supply of the chest wall involves the intercostal nerves, which are the anterior rami of the thoracic spinal nerves. These nerves supply the intrinsic muscles of the chest (intercostal muscles), the parietal pleura, the skin overlying the chest wall, and the parietal serous membrane surrounding the inside of the chest wall. They also provide sensory innervation to these structures. The intercostal nerves function to transmit sensory information, such as pain, touch, and temperature, from the chest wall to the central nervous system. They also play a role in motor control, providing motor innervation to the intercostal muscles, which are involved in breathing and maintaining the stability of the chest wall.

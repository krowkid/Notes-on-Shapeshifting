###### **PART 1**
The size of a healthy heart is roughly the size of a person’s clenched fist. However, in response to pathology, the heart has to work harder to overcome the disease. When the heart contracts more, it enlarges, much like any other muscle that is pushed to the limit.

Cardiac percussion is used to determine heart size by tapping the chest wall to listen for a dull echo. The examiner starts tapping in the 5th intercostal space in the midaxillary line and progresses medially until the sound changes from resonant to dull. This marks the left border of the heart. Resonance is heard over lung tissue, and dullness over the heart. By percussing the chest, the examiner can determine the actual size of a patient’s heart. Surface anatomy is significant in understanding the heart as it allows for the mapping out of the position of the heart against the chest wall. By locating the apex beat and the lower right border of the heart, and mapping out the outline of the heart by joining the dots together with curved lines, one can understand the position and size of the heart in relation to the chest wall. 

The layers of the heart wall include the fibrous pericardium, parietal (serous) pericardium, and visceral (serous) pericardium. The fibrous pericardium serves as a protective cover for the heart, attached inferiorly to the central tendon of the diaphragm and blending into the adventitia of the great vessels as they enter and leave the heart. The parietal layer is a serous membrane adherent to the inside of the fibrous layer, and it is reflected around the great vessels entering and leaving the heart before turning over onto the surface of the heart to become the visceral pericardium. The space between the parietal and visceral layers of pericardium is the pericardial cavity, which contains a small amount of fluid to reduce the friction caused by the beating of the heart. Pericardial fluid is important as it reduces the friction caused by the beating of the heart. Normally, there is between 10-50 mL of fluid in the pericardial cavity, and it is produced by the serous layers. This fluid acts as a lubricant, allowing the layers of the pericardium to slide against each other during heart contractions, reducing friction and preventing damage to the heart.

Epicardial fat is a layer of fat located between the visceral pericardium and the outer surface of the heart. Excessive epicardial fat has been linked to a negative impact on heart function and is associated with coronary artery disease. The transverse and oblique pericardial sinuses serve the purpose of allowing movement and flexibility of the heart within the pericardial cavity, as well as facilitating the passage of blood vessels.

Pericarditis is characterized by inflammation of the pericardium, resulting in pain due to the sensitivity of the fibrous and parietal pericardial membranes. The condition can cause referred pain over the shoulder, as the irritation of the sensory receptors in the pericardium is interpreted by the brain as coming from the C3-5 dermatomes. This can lead to confusion with other diseases of the chest and abdomen. Cardiac tamponade occurs when the pericardial cavity fills with excessive amounts of fluid, which can be pericardial fluid or blood due to a leak in the heart wall and serous pericardium. This condition can be fatal if left untreated, as the excess fluid puts pressure on the heart, leading to an inability to expand sufficiently during the relaxation phase. This results in elevated venous pressure, reduced cardiac output, circulatory shock, and a lack of oxygen to body tissues, potentially leading to heart attack. The treatment for cardiac tamponade involves draining the pericardial fluid through a procedure called pericardial tap, which is performed by inserting a needle upwards and to the left, immediately adjacent to the xiphisternum, while avoiding the internal thoracic artery. However, it's important to note that this procedure is extremely hazardous and should be performed with caution.

###### **PART 2**
The heart is initially positioned with the apex pointing downwards and the base facing upwards, with a right side, a left side, and an anterior and posterior surface. However, in the 4th week of intrauterine life, the heart rotates to the left and tilts upwards. The anterior surface becomes the superior surface, and the posterior surface becomes inferior. Additionally, the right side of the heart is now more anteriorly positioned, and the left side is more posterior. Despite these changes, the names of heart structures are based on the fetal position, which can be confusing. For example, the right coronary artery actually arises anteriorly, and the posterior interventricular artery lies inferiorly. This naming convention harkens back to the fetal position of these structures.

The heart consists of four chambers: two atria and two ventricles. The atria receive venous blood via the base and then contract to push the blood into the ventricles. The ventricles then pump the blood out of the heart into the outflow tracts, which are situated on the superior surface at the top of the ventricles. The right heart, comprising the right atrium and right ventricle, serves to pump deoxygenated blood returning from the body's systems to the lungs. The left atrium receives oxygenated blood returning from the lungs, and the left ventricle pumps it out via the aorta to circulate throughout the body. Blood flows through the heart in a specific sequence. Deoxygenated blood enters the right atrium from the body, then passes through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. From there, it is pumped through the pulmonary valve into the pulmonary artery, which carries it to the lungs for oxygenation. Oxygenated blood returns to the heart via the pulmonary veins, entering the left atrium, then passing through the mitral valve into the left ventricle. Finally, it is pumped out through the aortic valve into the aorta to be distributed throughout the body.

The surface of the heart contains grooves (sulci) corresponding to the divisions of its four chambers. The sulci are most prominent between the atria and ventricles, and between the two ventricles. The atrioventricular sulcus is more commonly referred to as the coronary sulcus. The term "coronary" means "crown," and it is significant because it marks the location where a crown would sit comfortably on the atrioventricular groove. The coronary sulcus contains blood vessels, including the coronary arteries and their branches, as well as the cardiac veins. These vessels are embedded in epicardial fat. The interventricular sulci, which are the grooves between the ventricles, include the anterior and posterior interventricular sulcus. These sulci are significant because they also contain blood vessels, specifically the coronary arteries and their branches, and the cardiac veins. The crux of the heart, which is the site of union of the sulci, is located at the back of the heart. It is important because it is the point where the sulci meet, and it is known as the crux of the heart, with "crux" meaning "cross" in Latin.

The right atrium is mostly observed from an anterior view, while the right ventricle is also seen from an anterior view. On the other hand, the left side of the heart, including the left atrium and the majority of the left ventricle, is mostly observed from a posterior view. The left ventricle is curved on its left side, presenting a rounded surface heading upwards to the anterior surface. This margin of the heart is referred to as the obtuse margin.

The contractions of the atria and ventricles are coordinated to ensure efficient blood flow through the heart. The atria contract during atrial systole, which occurs while the ventricles are relaxed (ventricular diastole). This contraction helps to push blood into the ventricles. Subsequently, the ventricles contract during ventricular systole, closing the atrioventricular valves and opening the outflow valves. This coordinated contraction sequence ensures that blood is pumped effectively from the atria to the ventricles and then out of the heart. The cardiac skeleton plays a crucial role in muscle contraction. It is a fibrous tissue that surrounds the heart valves and provides attachment points for the heart muscle fibers. The atrial muscle contracts downwards towards the cardiac skeleton, while the ventricular muscle contracts upwards towards it. This arrangement helps to ensure that the muscle fibers of the ventricles are spiraled, allowing the ventricular chambers to be "wrung out" upon contraction, which aids in complete or near-complete emptying of the ventricles.

The atrioventricular valves, including the tricuspid and mitral valves, prevent the backflow of blood from the ventricles to the atria during ventricular systole. The semilunar valves, including the pulmonary and aortic valves, prevent the backflow of blood from the pulmonary artery and aorta into the ventricles during ventricular diastole. These valves play a crucial role in maintaining the unidirectional flow of blood through the heart. The heart valves open and close during specific phases of the cardiac cycle. The atrioventricular valves open when the ventricles are relaxed (ventricular diastole) and close when the ventricles contract (ventricular systole). The semilunar valves close when the ventricles relax and open when the ventricles contract to pump blood into the pulmonary artery and aorta.

The heart shape is compared to a wedge, with the apex representing the left-hand side of the thin end of the wedge, and the base being the thick end. The anterior surface is superior, and the posterior surface is inferior. The left and right sides of the wedge form the right and left borders of the heart, known as the pulmonary surfaces because they are adjacent to the lungs. The left ventricle is curved on its left side, presenting a rounded surface heading upwards to the anterior surface, which is referred to as the obtuse margin.

The acute margin of the heart is the sharp turn where the heart sits on the diaphragm, and the posterior part of the right ventricle is in contact with the central tendon of the diaphragm. The obtuse margin is the rounded surface of the left ventricle, which is curved on its left side and heads upwards to the anterior surface. The pulmonary surfaces of the heart are related to the lungs as they are adjacent to them. The right pulmonary surface is principally the right atrium, while the left pulmonary surface is the left ventricle. These surfaces are in close proximity to the lungs, reflecting the anatomical relationship between the heart and the lungs.

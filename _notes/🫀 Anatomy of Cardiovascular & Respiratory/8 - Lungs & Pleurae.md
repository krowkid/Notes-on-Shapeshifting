###### **PART 1**
The lungs are remarkably dynamic organs, undergoing inflation and deflation roughly 12-15 times per minute during quiet breathing. Positioned within the thoracic cavity, the lungs consist of an apex above the thoracic inlet and a base resting on the diaphragm. Their interior is characterised by a costal surface enclosed by the rib cage and a mediastinal surface adjacent to the heart and pericardium. Notably, the left lung is smaller than the right, accommodating the heart within a cardiac notch.

Healthy lung tissue exhibits a vibrant pink hue owing to its robust vascularity, observable in unembalmed cadavers or in young individuals. Conversely, exsanguinated lungs, deprived of blood, take on a whitish appearance. Lymphatic vessels beneath the visceral pleura manifest as grey to black lines on their surface. Furthermore, adult lungs often display a mottled appearance, reflecting the accumulation of carbon particles and other inhaled impurities cleared from the airway by macrophages and transported by lymphatics to the visceral pleural surface.

In smokers, lung surfaces can turn entirely black due to the presence of over 200 toxins per cigarette. Despite efforts by macrophages and lymphatics to cleanse the lungs, their efficacy diminishes with age, leading to increasingly darker appearances. Beyond cigarettes, harmful chemicals in the air, even in rural areas, contribute to lung discolouration, with city-dwelling lungs resembling those of smokers in their blackened state.

The lungs consist of lobes, each served by a main bronchus and divided further into distinct sections guided by the branching pattern of the main bronchus through lobar bronchi. These lobes are separated by fissures, forming the basis of the lung's structural organisation.

In the right lung, three lobes - upper, middle, and lower - are delineated by oblique and horizontal fissures. Positioned differently within the thoracic cavity, the inferior lobe is posterior and inferior due to the oblique fissure, while the superior lobe is anterior and superior. The middle lobe, found solely anteriorly and laterally, completes the trio.

Contrarily, the left lung accommodates two lobes - upper and lower - with a notch on its medial side where it contacts the heart, termed the cardiac notch. The lower part of the superior lobe extends in front of the heart, known as the lingula, while an oblique fissure divides the two lobes.

In a cadaver, the collapsed state of the lungs portrays a smaller appearance than in life. In living individuals, the anterior borders of the lungs nearly touch, a contrast to the visible gap in the specimen. Notably, the cardiac notch of the left lung is distinctly visible here, although in life, it would cover more of the heart.

The location of the parietal pleura, indicated by yellow lines in an illustration, shows its positioning beneath the suprapleural membrane at the chest's top, situated 2.5cms above the medial end of the clavicle. At the chest's front behind the sternum, the parietal pleurae on each side nearly converge, deviating from each other beyond the 4th costal cartilage, especially prominent on the left due to the heart's presence. Extending to the midclavicular line and reaching the 8th rib, the parietal pleura on both sides shifts to the 10th rib at the midaxillary line and posteriorly wraps around to the 12th rib.

In the upper chest, the visceral pleura aligns with the parietal pleura initially, but anteriorly from the level of the 6th costal cartilage, the visceral pleura diverges, signified by the purple line. At the midclavicular line, the visceral pleura reaches the 6th costal cartilage, extends to the 8th rib at the midaxillary line, and posteriorly wraps around to the 10th rib. This results in a two-rib separation, forming the costodiaphragmatic recess, crucial for drainage of pleural fluid via catheter insertion at the 9th intercostal space in the midaxillary line. Additionally, this space is utilised for liver biopsies to prevent lung damage since the liver lies behind the ribs.

These markings illustrate the lungs in full expiration. Despite full inspiration, the lungs typically avoid extending downwards into this recess.

The red markings denote the surface locations of the lung fissures. The horizontal fissure spans the 5th rib in the midaxillary line, crossing the 4th intercostal space and reaching the level of the 4th costal cartilage anteriorly. Meanwhile, the oblique fissure runs from the 3rd thoracic spine to the 6th costal cartilage.

Due to the wedge-shaped nature of the lungs, examining the upper lobe from the front and the lower lobe from the back is optimal. For auscultation using a stethoscope, the upper lobe, generally above the level of the 4th costal cartilage, can be located using the male nipple as a guide. The middle lobe, positioned between the 4th and 6th costal cartilage, can be approached below the male nipple. Meanwhile, for the lower lobe, aligning the medial border of the scapula with the line of the oblique fissure assists in stethoscope placement below that bone.

To conduct auscultation effectively, a systematic approach is essential. Commencing at the apex situated above the medial end of the clavicle, progress downwards by two ribs to examine the area below. Start with the upper lobe, placing the stethoscope in the 2nd intercostal space, followed by the middle lobe at the 4th intercostal space on the right, and finally, the inferior lobe more laterally in the 6th intercostal space. Auscultation serves as a valuable method, complemented by percussion to detect changes in sound, where a diseased lung may produce a dull tone.

Alternatively, a posterior approach allows for examination of the upper and lower lobes, particularly useful when abnormalities are confined to one side. However, note that the presence of the scapula obstructs auscultation of the upper lobe, allowing only medial examination. The lower lobe's upper part can be obscured by the scapula as well, but asking the patient to place their hands on their head can rotate the scapula away, facilitating access to the lower lobe. Notably, auscultation of the middle lobe is not feasible through the posterior approach.
###### **PART 2**
The lung root, situated at the hilum, serves as the passage for structures entering and exiting the lungs. Enclosed by pleura, it includes the pulmonary ligament, enabling lung expansion during inspiration. Within this area, the bronchus lies at the back, while arteries are above and in front, and veins are below. Each lung's main bronchus divides within the lung substance, accompanied by branches of the pulmonary artery, situated superiorly. The pulmonary veins, slightly displaced from the bronchus, are found anteriorly and inferiorly. Blood supply to the bronchi and conducting system in the lung comes from bronchial arteries, while lymphatics and nodes are present in the lung substance and at the hilum. Pathological enlargements, like lymph nodes or bronchial cancer, can impede nearby structures and blood flow. Sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves are present near the bronchial tree. Considering the relationships of the right lung hila, notable structures, largely venous, include the right atrium, the vena cavae, the arch of the azygos vein, the oesophagus posteriorly, and indentations from the subclavian vessels and 1st rib near the apex. Enlargement of structures within the lung root can affect these neighbouring structures as well.

The left lung's relations around its hilum are primarily arterial. Positioned anteriorly, the heart creates the cardiac notch, with the aorta arching over the left lung root and becoming a posterior relation. The oesophagus also lies behind the left lung root. Near the apex, there's an indentation due to the subclavian vessels and the 1st rib. Understanding these relationships is crucial in clinical contexts; for instance, bronchial cancer within the lung root might compress the oesophagus, causing swallowing difficulties or affecting the azygos vein and aorta.

Lobar bronchi further divide into segmental (tertiary) bronchi, supplying distinct territories known as bronchopulmonary segments, totaling 10 in each lung. Combining pairs of segments in both upper and lower lobes results in 8 segments in the left lung. While these territories can be identified through coloured dye injected into each tertiary bronchus, memorization isn't necessary. Surgical removal of these lung segments, aerated and supplied by corresponding arterial, venous, and lymphatic divisions, can be performed with minimal bleeding, beneficial in cases like lung cancer.

Illustrating the bronchial tree dissection within the lungs, the left lung displays two lobar bronchi, while the right lung has three. Each lobar bronchus further divides into segmental bronchi, supplying named bronchopulmonary segments, aiding in surgical precision.

The asymmetry of the main bronchi often directs inhaled foreign objects more frequently into the right bronchus. When standing, these objects typically travel to the basal segments of the lower lobe. However, when a person is supine, as during surgery, the material usually flows into the posterior segments of the lung, particularly the posterior segment of the upper lobe, the superior segment of the lower lobe, and the posterior basal segment of the lower lobe.

Understanding lung lymphatic drainage is vital due to common conditions like lung cancer, especially among smokers, which often spread via lymphatic routes. In the right lung, lymphatics drain through various nodes, ultimately reaching the right broncho-mediastinal lymph trunk. The left upper lobe follows a similar path, sometimes joining the thoracic duct. However, the lower lobe of the left lung drains bilaterally, with most lymph traveling towards the right broncho-mediastinal nodes. Enlarged lymph nodes on the right aren't solely indicative of issues from that side; some lymph from both sides may join neck lymphatics.

Nerve fibres reach the lungs through the pulmonary plexuses, where sympathetic nerves primarily cause vasoconstriction, and parasympathetic nerves lead to bronchoconstriction and mucus secretion. Pleural irritation from fractures or other causes differs in sensitivity: visceral pleura is relatively insensitive, whereas parietal pleura is highly sensitive. The costal parietal pleura receives sensation from nearby intercostal nerves, causing localized pain. Diaphragmatic and mediastinal parietal pleurae sensation is via phrenic nerves (C3-5), leading to referred pain over the shoulder (the C4 dermatome particularly).

The realm of autonomic actions in the lungs indeed harbours conflicting information in textbooks. While some assert that sympathetic nerves induce bronchodilation, such findings are mostly observed in animal studies and aren't reliably applicable to humans. In humans, the lungs primarily rely on vagal afferents, managing irritant and stretch receptors responsible for the coughing reflex. Although there might exist a few pain afferents transmitted via sympathetic nerves to spinal cord levels T1 to T4, inhaled foreign bodies or lung cancers typically do not trigger pain responses.

Contrary to some literature, studies explicitly state that sympathetic nerves don't directly supply airway smooth muscles in humans. However, medications like Salbutamol, a Beta2-adrenergic agonist, are known to aid airway dilation in asthma patients. This contradiction might suggest that sympathetic nerves potentially influence parasympathetic nerves. Parasympathetic nerves function as bronchoconstrictors, and by inhibiting their action, sympathetic nerves indirectly contribute to bronchodilation.

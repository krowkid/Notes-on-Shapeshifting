###### **PART 1**
Skeletal muscle is a crucial type of muscle tissue that is multinucleated and unbranched. It is responsible for generating force for movement, breathing, postural support, heat production, and metabolism. Skeletal muscles attach to the skeleton via tendons and cause movement at joints. They are composed of muscle fibers, which are single muscle cells that are packed with myofibrils (contractile proteins) and mitochondria.

There are three types of muscle tissue: skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and smooth muscle.

- **Skeletal muscle**: This type of muscle is responsible for voluntary movements and is attached to the skeleton via tendons. It is multinucleated and unbranched, and its main role is to generate force for movement, breathing, postural support, heat production, and metabolism.
- **Cardiac muscle**: Found only in the heart, cardiac muscle is responsible for involuntary contractions that pump blood throughout the body. It is striated and branched, and its contractions are coordinated by specialized cells called pacemaker cells.
- **Smooth muscle**: Smooth muscle is found in the walls of hollow organs, blood vessels, and other structures. It is responsible for involuntary movements such as peristalsis and the regulation of blood flow. Smooth muscle cells are spindle-shaped and lack striations.

Muscle fibers are the individual cells that make up skeletal muscle. They are multinucleated and can range in diameter from 40-100 um. Each muscle fiber is a single muscle cell that contains myofibrils, which are thread-like structures packed with contractile proteins, and mitochondria for energy generation.

The primary job of the bulk of skeletal muscles is to move the skeleton. Muscles attach to the skeleton via tendons, and when they contract, they generate force that pulls on the tendons, causing movement at the joints. This movement allows us to perform various activities such as walking, running, lifting objects, and even facial expressions. The coordinated contraction and relaxation of different muscle groups enable us to have precise control over our movements.

Muscle arrangements refer to the organisation and structure of muscles. Muscles work in pairs called antagonistic muscles, where one muscle bends the joint (flexor muscle) and the other straightens the joint (extensor muscle). The same muscle can act as a prime mover (agonist), antagonist, synergist, or fixator under different conditions or different actions. The tendons, which are made of collagen fibers, attach muscles to the skeleton and transmit muscle force to the bone.

There are two types of muscle contractions: isotonic and isometric.

Isotonic contractions involve changes in muscle length and can be further divided into concentric and eccentric contractions. Concentric contractions occur when the muscle shortens during force production, such as when lifting a weight. Eccentric contractions occur when the muscle produces force, but its length increases, such as when lowering a weight.

Isometric contractions occur when the muscle exerts force without changing length. This can happen when pulling against an immovable object or when maintaining a static position, such as in postural muscles.

The functions of muscles are diverse and essential for various bodily processes. Here are some of the main functions of muscles:

- **Force generation for movement and breathing**: Skeletal muscles generate the force required for voluntary movements, such as walking, running, and lifting objects. They also play a crucial role in breathing by contracting the diaphragm and other respiratory muscles to expand and contract the lungs.
- **Force generation for postural support**: Muscles help maintain posture and stabilize the body against gravity. They work continuously to keep the body upright and maintain balance.
- **Heat production**: Muscles generate heat as a byproduct of their metabolic activity. This heat production helps regulate body temperature and is particularly important during exercise or in cold environments.
- **Metabolism**: Skeletal muscles play a role in metabolism by utilizing glucose and fatty acids for energy production. They also serve as a reservoir for amino acids, which are important for protein synthesis and other metabolic processes.

Skeletal muscle has a specific structure and is surrounded by connective tissue. The connective tissue provides support and protection to the muscle fibers and helps transmit force to the tendons.

The general structure of skeletal muscle includes muscle fiber, fascicles (bundles of muscle fibers surrounded by perimysium), epimysium (the connective tissue surrounding the entire muscle), and tendons, which link muscles to the skeleton.

The myotendinous junction is the area where the muscle fibers merge with the dense collagenous connective tissue of the tendon. It is the site where the force generated by the muscle is transmitted to the tendon and ultimately to the bone. The myotendinous junction is crucial for the efficient transfer of force and allows for coordinated movement.
###### **PART 2**
The formation of skeletal muscle begins during embryonic development, originating from embryonic structures called somites, which are segmented blocks of paraxial mesoderm. The process of muscle formation, known as myogenesis, involves several steps.

1. **Specification**: During early development, specific populations of cells within the somites become committed to the skeletal muscle lineage. These cells are called myoblasts, which are proliferative cells committed to making skeletal muscle.
2. **Proliferation**: Myoblasts undergo rapid proliferation, increasing their numbers. This proliferation is regulated by various growth factors and signaling molecules.
3. **Differentiation**: As myoblasts continue to proliferate, they start to differentiate into myocytes, which are mononucleated differentiated muscle cells. During differentiation, myocytes acquire the characteristic features of muscle cells, such as the expression of contractile proteins.
4. **Fusion**: Differentiated myocytes then undergo fusion to form myotubes, which are immature muscle fibers. Myotubes contain multiple nuclei, which are derived from the fusion of myocytes. This fusion process is essential for the formation of multinucleated muscle fibers.
5. **Maturation**: Myotubes further mature and undergo a process called myofibrillogenesis, where myofibrils, which are rod-like structures composed of contractile proteins, are organized within the myotubes. This organization gives rise to the striated appearance of skeletal muscle.

Throughout the process of muscle formation, a population of stem cells called satellite cells remains associated with the muscle fibers. Satellite cells are normally mitotically quiescent but can be activated to enter the cell cycle and differentiate into myoblasts. They play a crucial role in muscle growth, maintenance, repair, and regeneration. 

Satellite cells are a population of resident muscle stem cells that play a crucial role in muscle growth, maintenance, repair, and regeneration. They are located on the surface of muscle fibers, beneath the basal lamina and in close proximity to the plasmalemma.

Satellite cells are normally in a quiescent state, meaning they are not actively dividing. However, they have the ability to be activated in response to various stimuli, such as muscle injury or exercise. When activated, satellite cells enter the cell cycle and undergo proliferation, generating a population of myoblasts. These myoblasts can then differentiate into myocytes, which can either fuse with existing muscle fibers to provide new myonuclei or fuse together to form new myofibers.

Satellite cells also have the ability to self-renew, which means they can divide and produce more satellite cells to maintain the stem cell population. This self-renewal capacity is important for the long-term maintenance and regeneration of skeletal muscle.

The presence of satellite cells in skeletal muscle is essential for its ability to adapt and repair. They contribute to muscle growth and hypertrophy in response to exercise or increased demand. Additionally, satellite cells play a critical role in muscle regeneration after injury or disease, as they can differentiate and replace damaged or lost muscle fibers.

The sarcomere is the basic contractile unit of skeletal muscle, responsible for generating force and producing muscle contractions. It is organised in a highly structured manner, allowing for efficient muscle contraction.

The sarcomere is composed of two major protein filaments: thick filaments made of myosin and thin filaments made of actin. These filaments are arranged in a specific pattern within the sarcomere, giving rise to its characteristic striated appearance.

The organisation of the sarcomere includes the following key components:
- **A-band**: The A-band is the dark region of the sarcomere and represents the length of the thick filaments. It contains overlapping thick and thin filaments.
- **I-band**: The I-band is the light region of the sarcomere and represents the length of the thin filaments. It contains only thin filaments and is located between the A-bands.
- **Z-line**: The Z-line is a protein structure that bisects the I-band and serves as an anchor for the thin filaments. It provides structural stability and helps maintain the alignment of the sarcomeres.
- **H-zone**: The H-zone is a region within the A-band where there is no overlap between the thick and thin filaments. It appears lighter in color due to the absence of thin filaments.

During muscle contraction, the sarcomere shortens as the Z-lines move closer together. The I-band and H-zone narrow, but the A-band remains the same length.

The organized arrangement of the sarcomere allows for the sliding filament mechanism of muscle contraction. When muscle fibers receive signals from motor neurons, the myosin heads of the thick filaments bind to the actin filaments and pull them towards the center of the sarcomere. This sliding of the filaments results in the shortening of the sarcomere and the generation of force.

Muscle fibers can be subdivided into different types based on their speed of contraction and metabolic properties. Fast and slow muscle fibers have distinct characteristics and play different roles in muscle function.

Fast muscle fibers, also known as Type II fibers, contract quickly and generate high levels of force. They are adapted for rapid, powerful movements and are involved in activities such as sprinting or weightlifting. Fast muscle fibers have a high capacity for anaerobic metabolism, meaning they can generate energy without the need for oxygen. They rely primarily on glycolysis, which breaks down glucose to produce ATP quickly. Fast muscle fibers have a lower density of mitochondria and myoglobin, a protein that stores oxygen, compared to slow muscle fibers.

On the other hand, slow muscle fibers, also known as Type I fibers, contract more slowly and have a lower force-generating capacity. They are involved in activities that require endurance, such as long-distance running or cycling. Slow muscle fibers have a high capacity for aerobic metabolism, meaning they can generate energy using oxygen. They rely primarily on oxidative phosphorylation, which utilizes oxygen to produce ATP more efficiently. Slow muscle fibers have a higher density of mitochondria and myoglobin, allowing for sustained energy production and oxygen storage.

The metabolic properties of fast and slow muscle fibers are reflected in their different fiber type compositions. Most muscles in the human body are a mixture of both fast and slow muscle fibers, with varying proportions depending on the muscle's function and the individual's training or genetic factors. The relative distribution of fast and slow muscle fibers can influence an individual's athletic performance and determine their predisposition to certain types of physical activities.

Fiber-type specification refers to the process by which muscle fibers acquire their specific characteristics, such as their contractile properties and metabolic profiles. This specification is influenced by various factors, including genetic factors, motor neuron innervation, and functional demands placed on the muscle.

Motor neuron innervation plays a crucial role in fiber-type specification. Each muscle fiber is innervated by a motor neuron, and the type of motor neuron that innervates a fiber determines its fiber type. Motor neurons release specific neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine, which bind to receptors on the muscle fiber membrane and initiate muscle contraction.

Different motor neurons have different properties and can innervate different types of muscle fibers. Motor neurons that innervate slow muscle fibers (Type I fibers) have a lower firing rate and release acetylcholine more slowly, leading to slower and sustained contractions. On the other hand, motor neurons that innervate fast muscle fibers (Type II fibers) have a higher firing rate and release acetylcholine more rapidly, resulting in faster and more forceful contractions.

The specific motor neuron that innervates a muscle fiber is determined during development through a process called motor unit recruitment. Motor units consist of a single motor neuron and all the muscle fibers it innervates. During development, motor neurons selectively innervate specific muscle fibers based on their properties and functional requirements. This process helps establish the fiber-type composition of a muscle.

Motor unit recruitment can also be influenced by external factors, such as exercise and training. Regular exercise and specific training regimens can lead to changes in motor unit recruitment, resulting in adaptations in muscle fiber type composition. For example, endurance training can increase the proportion of slow muscle fibers, while strength training can increase the proportion of fast muscle fibers.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic disorder characterised by progressive muscle weakness and degeneration. It primarily affects boys and is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, which is located on the X chromosome. Dystrophin is a large protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of muscle fibers.

Dystrophin is part of a protein complex called the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC), which is located at the sarcolemma, the membrane surrounding muscle fibers. The DAPC helps link the contractile apparatus of the muscle fibers to the extracellular matrix, providing structural stability during muscle contraction. Dystrophin acts as a shock absorber, transmitting force laterally across the sarcolemma to the extracellular matrix.

In individuals with DMD, mutations in the dystrophin gene result in the absence or severe reduction of dystrophin protein. Without dystrophin, the sarcolemma becomes more susceptible to damage during muscle contraction, leading to repeated cycles of muscle fiber degeneration and regeneration. Over time, this cycle of degeneration and regeneration leads to the replacement of muscle fibers with fibrous and adipose tissue, resulting in muscle weakness and loss of function.

The loss of dystrophin also disrupts the normal signaling pathways within muscle fibers, leading to impaired calcium handling and increased oxidative stress, further contributing to muscle damage.
###### **PART 3**
During embryogenesis, muscle formation begins with the development of somites, which are embryonic structures that give rise to various tissues, including skeletal muscles. The process of muscle formation, known as myogenesis, involves the proliferation, differentiation, and fusion of myoblasts to form mature muscle fibers.

Myogenesis starts with the specification of myoblasts, which are precursor cells committed to becoming muscle cells. Myoblasts arise from the dermomyotome, a region of the somite that gives rise to both muscle and dermis. The dermomyotome contains a population of cells called myogenic progenitors, which express specific transcription factors known as myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs), including MyoD and Myogenin. These MRFs play a crucial role in driving myoblast differentiation and muscle formation.

Once specified, myoblasts undergo proliferation, increasing their numbers. They then exit the cell cycle and begin to differentiate into myocytes, which are mononucleated muscle cells. Myocytes further differentiate and align themselves to form myotubes, which are immature muscle fibers. Myotubes contain multiple myonuclei, which are the nuclei of the myocytes. The myotubes continue to mature and undergo further fusion, resulting in the formation of multinucleated muscle fibers.

The formation of individual muscles is a complex process that involves the interaction between myoblasts and the surrounding connective tissues. The development of muscle connective tissue, such as tendons and bones, is regulated by different signaling pathways and transcription factors. These extrinsic signals play a role in instructing myoblasts to differentiate into specific muscle types and guiding their migration to the appropriate locations within the limb bud.

Muscle differentiation refers to the process by which myoblasts, which are precursor cells committed to becoming muscle cells, undergo a series of molecular and cellular changes to become mature muscle fibers. This process is regulated by various intrinsic and extrinsic signals.

Intrinsic signals involved in muscle differentiation include the expression of specific transcription factors known as myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs), including MyoD and Myogenin. These MRFs play a crucial role in driving myoblast differentiation and initiating the expression of muscle-specific genes. They activate the expression of genes involved in muscle fiber formation, such as those encoding contractile proteins and structural components of muscle fibers.

Extrinsic signals, on the other hand, are provided by the surrounding environment and play a critical role in muscle patterning. These signals guide the migration and positioning of myoblasts, ensuring that they form the correct muscles in the appropriate locations. Extrinsic signals can come from neighboring tissues, such as tendons, bones, and connective tissues, as well as from signaling molecules secreted by cells in the vicinity of developing muscles.

For example, studies have shown that the presence of specific extrinsic signals can influence the shape and attachment sites of developing muscles. In experiments using duck-quail chimeras, it was observed that the jaw muscles of the host duck acquired a quail-like shape and attachment sites due to the presence of quail donor neural crest-derived skeletal and muscular connective tissues. This suggests that extrinsic signals from connective tissues can influence muscle patterning.

The extrinsic signals involved in muscle patterning are mediated by various signaling pathways and transcription factors. For instance, the expression of genes such as Sox9, Runx2, Scx, and Tcf4 within skeletal and muscular connective tissues is spatiotemporally regulated and plays a role in determining muscle shape and attachment sites.

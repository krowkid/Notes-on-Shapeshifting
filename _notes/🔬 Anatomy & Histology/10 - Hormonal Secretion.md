###### **PART 1**
The endocrine system is a complex network of glands that produce and secrete hormones into the bloodstream to regulate various bodily functions and maintain homeostasis. It includes glands such as the pituitary gland, thyroid gland, adrenal glands, and reproductive glands. On the other hand, the nervous system is a network of specialized cells called neurons that transmit signals between different parts of the body. It includes the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. 

The main difference between the endocrine system and the nervous system lies in the way they transmit signals and regulate bodily functions. The endocrine system uses hormones, which are chemical messengers, to travel through the bloodstream and target specific cells or organs. In contrast, the nervous system uses electrical impulses and neurotransmitters to transmit signals rapidly between neurons. Another distinction is the speed and duration of their effects. The nervous system generally produces rapid, short-lived responses, while the endocrine system's effects are slower but longer-lasting. Hormones released by the endocrine system can have effects that last for minutes, hours, or even days. 

Hormones are chemical messengers produced by the endocrine glands that regulate various bodily functions and processes. They act as signals that travel through the bloodstream to target specific cells or organs, where they bind to specific receptors and initiate a response. Hormones play a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis, which is the body's ability to maintain a stable internal environment. They regulate processes such as metabolism, growth and development, reproduction, mood, sleep, and stress response. For example, insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that helps regulate blood sugar levels by facilitating the uptake of glucose into cells. Thyroid hormones, produced by the thyroid gland, regulate metabolism and energy production. Testosterone and estrogen are reproductive hormones that play a role in sexual development and fertility.

The human endocrine system consists of several glands and tissues that secrete hormones. Some of the major endocrine organs in the human body include:
1. Pituitary Gland: Located at the base of the brain, the pituitary gland is often referred to as the "master gland" because it controls the functions of other endocrine glands. It produces and releases hormones that regulate growth, reproduction, and various other bodily functions.
2. Thyroid Gland: Situated in the neck, the thyroid gland produces hormones that regulate metabolism, energy production, and growth and development.
3. Adrenal Glands: There are two adrenal glands, one on top of each kidney. They produce hormones such as cortisol, which helps regulate stress response, and adrenaline, which is involved in the body's "fight or flight" response.
4. Pancreas: The pancreas serves both digestive and endocrine functions. It produces insulin and glucagon, which regulate blood sugar levels and play a crucial role in metabolism.
5. Gonads: The gonads, which include the testes in males and ovaries in females, produce hormones such as testosterone and estrogen, which are involved in sexual development and reproduction.

In addition to these endocrine organs, there are other tissues in the body that secrete hormones. For example:
1. Adipose Tissue: Adipose tissue, or fat cells, produce hormones called adipokines that regulate metabolism, appetite, and inflammation.
2. Kidneys: The kidneys produce hormones such as erythropoietin, which stimulates the production of red blood cells, and renin, which helps regulate blood pressure.
3. Heart: The heart secretes hormones called natriuretic peptides, which help regulate blood pressure and fluid balance.

Endocrine delivery involves hormones secreted into the bloodstream and acting on distant target cells with specific receptors. Neuroendocrine combines the nervous and endocrine systems, with specialized neurons releasing hormones into the bloodstream. Paracrine delivery sees hormones released by cells acting on nearby cells in the same tissue or organ. Autocrine involves hormones acting on the cells that produced them, influencing their behavior.
###### **PART 2**
Hormones fall into several categories, with proteins and peptides being the majority. Small peptides like ADH (9 amino acids) and TRH (3 amino acids) are examples. There are also long chain proteins or polypeptides such as GH and insulin. Additionally, some hormones are glycoproteins, which are long polypeptides bound to carbohydrates, as seen in luteinising hormone. The synthesis of these hormones involves DNA transcription and translation. They are typically first synthesized as large preprohormones and then cleaved into prohormones by proteolytic enzymes. These prohormones are stored in cells as granules in secretory vesicles. When it's time to release the active hormone, this occurs through exocytosis, stimulated by an increase in cytosolic calcium levels. Peptide hormones, after release, diffuse into 'leaky' capillaries and often circulate in the blood unbound because they are water-soluble (polar), leading to relatively short half-lives. These types of hormones are found in various organs, including the hypothalamus, pituitary, parathyroids, GI tract, and pancreas.

Steroids, including sex hormones and adrenal cortex hormones, consist of four carbon rings (three with six carbons and one with five carbons). These fat-soluble lipids are derived from cholesterol and are synthesized in mitochondria and the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. They are not stored in glands, and their release depends on the rate of synthesis. Steroids can easily diffuse across plasma membranes and circulate in the blood, bound to proteins such as albumin, leading to long half-lives. These hormones are produced by various organs, including the adrenal gland, gonads, and placenta, with examples like estrogen.

Amines, including thyroid hormones, adrenaline, and melatonin, are a group of hormones derived from modified amino acids, particularly tyrosine. Thyroid hormones, such as thyroxine, and catecholamines, which contain a catechol ring, like adrenaline, fall into this category. Thyroid hormones are lipid-soluble, allowing them to cross cell membranes easily. They circulate in the blood bound to proteins, resulting in long half-lives, and are stored in the thyroid gland bound to thyroglobulin. On the other hand, catecholamines like adrenaline are water-soluble and cannot cross cell membranes. They circulate in the blood unbound, leading to short half-lives, and are stored intracellularly in secretory granules.

Eicosanoids are local chemical messengers that have diverse effects in various organs and tissues. Examples of eicosanoids include prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and thromboxanes. They primarily act through autocrine or paracrine activity. These compounds are derived from arachidonic acid, which is a fatty acid found in plasma membrane phospholipids. Prostaglandins, for instance, play various roles, such as promoting the inflammatory process in the immune system, contributing to ovulation in the reproductive system, and inhibiting gastric secretion in the digestive system.

Steroid hormones have specific receptors in the cell. These hormones can diffuse through the cell membrane and then bind to cytoplasmic or nuclear receptors. Once bound, the receptor/hormone complex, located in the cytoplasm, translocates to the nucleus. In the nucleus, a process called dimerisation occurs, where two receptor units come together at two half-sites on hormone response elements (HRE) of DNA. This binding to DNA stimulates the transcription of particular genes, initiating the cellular responses associated with steroid hormones.

Hormone secretion is typically controlled by four types of stimuli or inputs to endocrine cells: Changes in plasma concentrations of mineral ions, such as calcium, potassium, and sodium, can affect the secretion of hormones like PTH and aldosterone. Changes in plasma concentrations of organic nutrients, like glucose, play a role in regulating hormones such as insulin and glucagon. Neurotransmitters released from neurons that interact with endocrine cells can influence hormone secretion. Examples include the autonomic nervous system's control of the adrenal medulla, gastrointestinal hormones, and insulin. Upstream hormones or paracrine agents can also impact endocrine cells. This includes hormones from the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, among others.

###### **PART 3**
The pituitary, also known as the hypothysis, weighs less than 1g in humans. In the early 1930s, P.E. Smith introduced a surgical technique for removing the gland in rats, called hypophysectomy. Unfortunately, this procedure had severe effects on the body, leading to the death of all animals. This highlighted the essential nature of the pituitary gland. Hypophysectomy's effects include the cessation of growth and lactation, atrophy in the thyroid, adrenal cortex, and gonads, and disturbances in salt and water balance, carbohydrate metabolism, and protein metabolism. The pituitary consists of two main lobes: the adenohypophysis, which is glandular, and the neurohypophysis, with neuronal processes from SON and PVN. Additionally, there is an intermediate lobe that produces MSH, although it is not present in adult humans. This gland forms from two embryologically distinct ectodermal tissues: an invagination of the forebrain (diencephalon) giving rise to the posterior lobe and an outgrowth from the buccal cavity known as Rathke's pouch, forming the anterior lobe.

The posterior pituitary is under direct neuronal control, with its operation governed by neuronal projections from the brain. It primarily comprises axons of specific hypothalamic neurons, which extend downward and unite to create a bundle situated behind the anterior pituitary. Additionally, it forms the pituitary stalk, known as the infundibulum, which seems to suspend the entire pituitary gland from the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus plays a pivotal role in regulating hormone secretion, with the posterior pituitary being responsible for releasing two crucial hormones: Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH) and Oxytocin. These hormones are produced in specific nuclei within the hypothalamus, the supraoptic nucleus for ADH and the paraventricular nucleus for oxytocin. The process involves several steps: Synthesis of these hormones begins in cell bodies within these nuclei. After synthesis, the hormones are transported down axons. They are stored in nerve terminals. When specific neural stimuli are triggered, the hormones are released into the blood, entering the circulation.

Anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin, is a hormone with several important functions: ADH secretion is directly stimulated by increased plasma osmolality, which typically occurs due to a rise in plasma sodium levels. ADH is also secreted in response to low blood pressure, serving as an external stimulus for its release. ADH's primary role is to increase water resorption in the kidneys. This action reduces the osmolality of the blood, increasing blood volume and blood pressure. A deficiency in ADH can lead to a condition known as diabetes insipidus, a rare metabolic disorder characterized by symptoms of excessive urination (polyuria) and low blood pressure (hypotension). ADH is primarily released from the posterior pituitary gland and plays a crucial role in regulating water balance in the body.

Oxytocin, a hormone with significant roles in reproductive and maternal functions, responds to specific stimuli: Stretching of the cervix during childbirth and the suckling of the baby at the breast serve as external stimuli that trigger the secretion of oxytocin. This process involves positive feedback effects. Oxytocin, in response to these stimuli, enhances uterine contractions during childbirth (parturition) and promotes the ejection of milk after birth. It also plays a role in maternal behavior. In cases of oxytocin deficiency, there can be complications such as a failure to progress in labor and difficulties with breastfeeding, underlining the hormone's critical role in these processes.

The hypothalamus plays a central role in regulating the release of hormones through a multi-step process: Within the hypothalamus, hormones are synthesized and released. These hormones are then released at the median eminence, a specialized region. They travel down portal blood vessels, which act as a conduit to transport the hormones. Once they reach the anterior pituitary, these hypothalamic hormones exert control over the release of anterior pituitary hormones, thus regulating various endocrine functions in the body

The anterior pituitary is linked to the median eminence of the hypothalamus through a dense network of capillaries known as the pituitary portal blood system. During the 1930s and 1940s, there was a debate about the direction of blood flow within this system. Remarkably, Houssay and colleagues demonstrated in 1935 that the blood in the pituitary portal blood system flows from the hypothalamus to the pituitary. However, this important work was published in French and went largely unnoticed until the late 1940s.

The pituitary portal blood system is a crucial part of the pituitary's vascular network, where blood reaching the anterior pituitary follows a specific path: Blood passes through capillary loops via either long or short hypophyseal portal vessels. The superior hypophyseal artery supplies blood to the median eminence and the stalk. The inferior hypophyseal artery supplies the posterior lobe directly and the anterior lobe through short portal vessels. These two arteries, the superior and inferior hypophyseal arteries, are connected by the trabecular artery. Both lobes of the pituitary gland eventually drain into venous sinuses, completing the circulation of blood within this vital endocrine organ.
###### **PART 4**
The anterior pituitary gland serves a vital role in the endocrine system and consists of five distinct endocrine cell types, each responsible for the release of specific hormones: Gonadotroph cells, corticotrophs cells, somatotroph cells, lactotroph cells, thyrotroph cells. These cells collectively release six well-established hormones, which play various roles in the body: Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), Adrenocorticotrophic Hormone (ACTH), Luteinising Hormone (LH), Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), Growth Hormone (GH), which promotes growth by stimulating the release of liver hormones called somatomedins. It can also be categorized as a trophic hormone. Prolactin (PRL), the only hormone among these that does not stimulate the production or secretion of another downstream hormone.

Control of the anterior pituitary is a finely tuned process, and each of its hormones is regulated in a specific manner. However, there are common features in their control, primarily involving two main mechanisms:

1. **Hypothalamic Hypophysiotrophic Hormones**: These hormones are released into the pituitary portal system from nerve terminals in the median eminence of the hypothalamus. They play a vital role in stimulating the release of specific hormones from the anterior pituitary. Importantly, these hypophysiotrophic hormones are not present at detectable levels in the wider circulation, making them challenging to measure directly.
2. **Feedback by Target Gland Hormones**: This feedback system, often in the form of negative feedback, is crucial in regulating hormone levels. For example, in the regulation of thyroid hormone secretion, there is direct negative feedback at play. Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), secreted by the anterior pituitary, stimulates the synthesis and release of thyroid hormones from the thyroid gland. The level of free circulating thyroid hormone is sensed by the pituitary, which then regulates its own release rate through negative feedback on the secretion rate of TSH. The set point in this system is often considered as the release of Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamic neurosecretory cell.

Feedback control of hormones is a fundamental mechanism that helps endocrine systems maintain homeostasis. There are several types of feedback control, negative feedback is the most common mechanism and is essential for maintaining stable hormone levels. It comes in different forms:

1. **Long-loop negative feedback**: Involves the hormone's effects on the hypothalamus and pituitary, regulating hormone release.
2. **Short-loop negative feedback**: Occurs when a hormone directly inhibits its own release, often at the level of the pituitary.
3. **Ultrashort-loop negative feedback**: Involves even more localized feedback within specific target tissues.

Positive feedback, while less common, can also play a role in hormone regulation. In this mechanism, a hormone's actions stimulate the production or release of more of the same hormone, resulting in a cascade effect. For example, prior to ovulation, LH from the anterior pituitary stimulates the ovaries to secrete oestrogen, which, in turn, stimulates the anterior pituitary to secrete more LH. This creates a rapid surge of both LH and oestrogen, ultimately leading to ovulation.

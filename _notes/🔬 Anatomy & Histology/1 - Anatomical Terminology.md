# Passage
Anatomical planes are used to divide the human body, aiding in understanding cross-sections. The three commonly used planes are the coronal, sagittal, and transverse planes. The coronal plane separates the body into anterior and posterior sections, the sagittal plane divides it into left and right sections, and the transverse plane separates it into superior and inferior sections.

Anatomical terms of location describe the position of body structures relative to each other. These terms include anterior (front), posterior (back), superior (above), inferior (below), medial (towards the midline), lateral (away from the midline), proximal (closer to the point of attachment), distal (farther from the point of attachment), superficial (near the surface), and deep (further inside the body).

Anatomical terms of movement describe various movements that can occur in the body. These terms include flexion (decreasing the angle between body parts), extension (increasing the angle between body parts), abduction (movement away from the midline), adduction (movement towards the midline), medial rotation (rotating movement towards the midline), lateral rotation (rotating movement away from the midline), supination (flipping the hand with the palm facing up), pronation (flipping the hand with the palm facing down), inversion (movement of the sole towards the median plane), eversion (movement of the sole away from the median plane), circumduction (conical movement of a limb), dorsiflexion (decreasing the angle at the ankle joint, pointing the foot more superiorly), and plantarflexion (increasing the angle at the ankle joint, pointing the foot inferiorly).
# Summary
**Anatomical planes:**

- Coronal plane: separates the body into anterior and posterior sections
- Sagittal plane: divides the body into left and right sections
- Transverse plane: separates the body into superior and inferior sections

**Anatomical terms of location:**

- Anterior (front)
- Posterior (back)
- Superior (above)
- Inferior (below)
- Medial (towards the midline)
- Lateral (away from the midline)
- Proximal (closer to the point of attachment)
- Distal (farther from the point of attachment)
- Superficial (near the surface)
- Deep (further inside the body)

**Anatomical terms of movement:**

- Flexion (decreasing the angle between body parts)
- Extension (increasing the angle between body parts)
- Abduction (movement away from the midline)
- Adduction (movement towards the midline)
- Medial rotation (rotating movement towards the midline)
- Lateral rotation (rotating movement away from the midline)
- Supination (flipping the hand with the palm facing up)
- Pronation (flipping the hand with the palm facing down)
- Inversion (movement of the sole towards the median plane)
- Eversion (movement of the sole away from the median plane)
- Circumduction (conical movement of a limb)
- Dorsiflexion (decreasing the angle at the ankle joint, pointing the foot more superiorly)
- Plantarflexion (increasing the angle at the ankle joint, pointing the foot inferiorly)

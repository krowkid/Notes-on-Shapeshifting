###### **PART 1**
Medical imaging refers to the use of various technologies to create visual representations of the internal structures and functions of the human body. It plays a crucial role in the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of various medical conditions. Medical imaging allows healthcare professionals to visualize and analyze the anatomical and physiological changes occurring within the body, aiding in the detection of diseases, assessment of treatment effectiveness, and guiding surgical interventions. It is an essential tool for early detection, accurate diagnosis, and improved patient outcomes.

Pixels, or picture elements, constitute the grid in images. Image resolution, matrix size, and pixel count describe the number of pixels on each axis. Each pixel represents an intensity or grey-scale value, with intensity resolution denoting the range of possible values. Spatial resolution measures the smallest discernible detail in an image. Matrices provide a convenient representation for images. Many medical images are 3D stacks of 2D images, such as some MRI, CT, and ultrasound images. In 3D images, pixels become voxels (volume elements), and they have a specified size, usually in millimetres. In most cases, the 2D (x, y) dimensions are the same, while the third (z) dimension, like slice thickness in CT, is typically larger. Numerous image file formats exist, including JPG, BMP, GIF, and TIFF. However, in medical imaging, the predominant format is DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine). DICOM is a non-compressed file format, and it is generally advisable to avoid lossy compression formats for storing medical images.

There are two primary techniques for visualisation in medical imaging: slice mode (viewed one slice or cross-section at a time) and volume mode. Volume mode visualization entails projecting a 3-D dataset onto a 2-D image and can be categorised into three main types: MIP (Maximum Intensity Projection), surface rendering, volume rendering. 

Attributing scientific discoveries can be challenging, particularly in the field of medical imaging. The typical timeline involves several key stages: proof of concept (supported by mathematical or physical arguments), practical implementation in phantoms or animals and practical implementation in clinical patients. One significant milestone in this journey was Wilhelm Röntgen's discovery of X-rays in 1895. Röntgen achieved this breakthrough earning him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901.

His journey towards this discovery was marked by key events: Initially, Röntgen covered Crookes' tube with cardboard, but fluorescence from a barium platinocyanide screen persisted. He then realised that he could create shadows of his hand on the screen using what he called "X-rays." Röntgen replaced the platinocyanide screen with photographic film. The first radiograph was taken of his wife Anna Bertha's hand, replacing the screen with photographic film. Remarkably, Röntgen submitted his discovery for publication on December 28, 1895, and it was published just a week later, on January 5, 1896 – a swift dissemination. Importantly, Röntgen made his discovery available for public use without pursuing personal financial gain, leading to the rapid adoption of this groundbreaking technology.

###### **PART 2**
Projective X-ray imaging was widely used from 1895 onwards. The first reported clinical use was for the removal of a needle from a patient’s hand in 1896 and it is still the most widely used form of medical imaging. The utilization of X-ray contrast agents dates back to 1906, with the primary application initially focused on imaging the kidneys. Notably, Werner Forssmann achieved a significant milestone in the field of medicine. In 1929, he conducted the first cardiac catheterization, a groundbreaking procedure. For his contributions, Forssmann was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 1956.

X-rays are generated when high-speed electrons collide with a target material, typically tungsten in medical applications. The energy of these X-rays is determined by the speed of the electrons and is measured in kiloelectronvolts (keV), with typical medical imaging energies ranging from 30 to 100 keV.

The attenuation of X-rays follows Lambert Beer's Law, and radiographic contrast is achieved when there are differences in the linear attenuation coefficient (µ) and X-ray intensity (I₀). In radiography, there are five X-ray densities used to distinguish materials: air, fat, soft tissue/water, bone, and metal. This variation in densities allows for the differentiation of structures and materials within the body.

The development of Computed Tomography (CT) was driven by the limitations of projective X-rays, where all structures appeared superimposed, making it impossible to determine the depth of objects. Johann Radon provided a breakthrough by formulating a method for reconstructing a 2D function from projections, known as the Radon Transform, in 1917.

The first CT image of a head phantom was created by William Oldendorf in 1961, using rather unconventional equipment, including his son's train set and a gramophone. Unfortunately, he faced challenges convincing medical equipment manufacturers of the value of his invention, with one response stating that there was no significant market for such an expensive apparatus that only produced radiographic cross-sections of a head.

However, history has shown the immense importance of Oldendorf's invention, as it marked the first practical realization of CT. Subsequently, Allan McLeod Cormack and Sir Godfrey Hounsfield made significant contributions to the development of CT technology, which has since become a fundamental tool in medical imaging.

In the evolution of CT scanning, the third generation is marked by several key advancements. This generation features a single-motion design with a fan beam, where both the detector and X-ray source rotate together. This system can be configured as a single-slice or multi-slice CT scanner, offering improved imaging capabilities.

One notable innovation in this era is the introduction of helical multidetector CT (MDCT), which allows for continuous data acquisition during a helical scan, enhancing image quality and diagnostic capabilities. In terms of general trends in CT technology, the third generation saw a focus on the following areas:

1. Faster scanning: Ability to acquire more images per second
2. Lower radiation dose: Efforts were made to reduce the radiation exposure, measured in millisieverts (mSv)
3. Interventional capabilities: Provide real-time imaging during interventional procedures
4. Dual-energy CT: Not just anatomical but also functional information



###### **PART 3**
Ionizing radiation refers to high-energy particles or electromagnetic waves that have enough energy to remove tightly bound electrons from atoms, resulting in the formation of ions. This type of radiation is commonly used in medical imaging techniques such as nuclear medicine and radiation therapy. Alpha decay is a type of radioactive decay in which an atomic nucleus emits an alpha particle, which consists of two protons and two neutrons. This decay process is commonly used in nuclear medicine imaging, particularly in the detection of certain types of cancer.

Beta-minus decay occurs when a neutron in the atomic nucleus is converted into a proton, and an electron (beta particle) is emitted. This decay process is used in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, where a radioactive tracer is introduced into the body and its decay is detected to create images of metabolic activity. Beta-plus decay, also known as positron decay, is the opposite of beta-minus decay. In this process, a proton in the atomic nucleus is converted into a neutron, and a positron (positive electron) is emitted. This decay process is also used in PET imaging, where the emitted positrons annihilate with electrons in the body, producing gamma rays that can be detected to create images.

Positron annihilation refers to the process in which a positron collides with an electron, resulting in the annihilation of both particles. This annihilation produces two gamma rays that are emitted in opposite directions. In PET imaging, the detection of these gamma rays allows for the creation of images that reflect the distribution of the radioactive tracer in the body. Detection of positron annihilation in PET imaging is achieved through the use of specialized detectors, such as the Philips Ingenuity TF PET-CT or Siemens Biograph mCT systems.

A gamma photon is a high-energy electromagnetic wave that is emitted during certain nuclear processes, such as radioactive decay. It is a type of ionizing radiation that can be detected and used in medical imaging. Gamma photons are helpful in medical imaging because they can penetrate through the body and are able to provide detailed information about the internal structures and functions. They are commonly used in techniques such as gamma camera imaging and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). There are several isotopes that emit gamma photons and are used in medical imaging. One example is technetium-99m (99mTc), which is the most widely used isotope in nuclear medicine. It emits gamma photons that can be detected by gamma cameras to create images of various organs and tissues in the body.

Decay kinetics refers to the mathematical description of how a radioactive substance decays over time. It involves the study of the rate at which radioactive atoms undergo decay and the resulting changes in the number of radioactive atoms present. The radioactive decay curve is a graphical representation of the decay kinetics of a radioactive substance. It shows the decrease in the number of radioactive atoms over time. The curve typically follows an exponential decay pattern, where the number of radioactive atoms decreases by a constant fraction during each time interval.

Half-life is a key concept in radioactive decay kinetics. It is defined as the time it takes for half of the radioactive atoms in a sample to undergo decay. The half-life is a characteristic property of each radioactive substance and can range from fractions of a second to billions of years. It is denoted by the symbol "t½" and is used to determine the rate of decay and the stability of a radioactive substance. The concept of half-life is important in various applications, including medical imaging and radiation therapy. For example, in nuclear medicine imaging, isotopes with short half-lives are used to minimize the radiation exposure to patients, while isotopes with longer half-lives are used for imaging over longer periods of time.
###### **PART 4**
The history of medical imaging and the development of nuclear medicine techniques have significantly advanced over the years. In 1948, the first thyroid image using radioactive iodine marked a significant milestone in the field. This pioneering work was attributed to Ansell and Rotblat. Shortly thereafter, in 1949, Copeland and Benjamin introduced the concept of the gamma camera, which became a cornerstone of nuclear medicine. The widespread availability of 99Tcm, a gamma emitter, in 1947 further contributed to the field's growth.

It wasn't long before the practical gamma camera became a reality in 1952, thanks to Anger. In 1953, the development of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) by Brownell and Sweet ushered in a new era of medical imaging. PET utilised a ring of detectors to count coincidental gamma photons, expanding the range of applications in nuclear medicine. In 1963, Kuhl and Edwards demonstrated Single Photon Emission Tomography (SPECT), a technique similar to CT scanning, which involved rotating a gamma camera around the patient. These advancements paved the way for a multitude of clinical and research applications.

Different isotopes with varying half-lives found use as tracers in nuclear medicine. Isotopes like 15O, 11C, 13N, and 18F, each with their unique properties, became crucial in different applications. Short half-lives and the need for a cyclotron for their production marked some of the challenges, but the versatility of these biological elements allowed for a wide range of clinical and research applications. Today, the vast majority of clinical applications in nuclear medicine, particularly in oncology, heavily rely on the use of 18FDG, a radiopharmaceutical that provides valuable insights into glucose metabolism and cancer diagnosis and treatment. Nuclear medicine continues to evolve and contribute significantly to the field of medical imaging. Annihilation Coincidence Detection in PET is a technique that detects two gamma rays created when a positron emitted by a radiotracer collides with an electron. By capturing these gamma rays simultaneously, it allows for precise localization of the radiotracer, enabling detailed imaging of metabolic processes in the body.

The foundations for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) were laid with the discovery of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in 1948. This groundbreaking development, independently achieved by Bloch and Purcell, earned them the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1952. However, it was in 1972 that Raymond Damadian patented the idea of a NMR scan, which later led to the invention of MRI. Two years later, in 1974, Peter Mansfield and Paul Lauterbur successfully implemented MRI technology, revolutionizing the field of medical imaging. 

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is a remarkable scientific technique that relies on the interplay of nuclear, magnetic, and resonance phenomena. In NMR, atomic nuclei are the stars of the show, responding to a magnetic field and absorbing energy from radiofrequency waves at a specific frequency.

The term "resonance" signifies a crucial aspect of this process, as it denotes the natural frequency of the system, much like the way a playground swing reaches its peak with well-timed pushes or an opera singer can shatter a glass with precisely tuned sound waves. In NMR, this resonance frequency is the key to efficient energy transfer, requiring radio waves of just the right frequency. To perform NMR, a sample is placed within a strong magnetic field and irradiated with radio waves at this resonance frequency. Subsequently, the sample re-emits radio waves, and the emitted signal can be carefully analyzed to extract valuable information about the sample. This technique is not only a standard method for chemical analysis but also serves as a non-destructive testing tool. In the realm of medical imaging, MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) utilizes magnetic field gradients to localize the signal and create detailed images.

Within the world of NMR, the hydrogen nucleus, particularly the 1H isotope, takes center stage. Hydrogen's simplicity with a single proton in its nucleus, its high NMR sensitivity, and its abundance in the human body, especially in water molecules (H2O), make it a preferred choice for biomedical MRI. Therefore, a significant portion of MRI in the biomedical field relies on 1H nuclei to provide crucial insights into the human body.

###### **PART 5**
The foundations of ultrasound imaging have a fascinating history, with key milestones and inventors contributing to its development. In 1915, Langevin made a significant breakthrough by inventing the hydrophone, primarily intended for locating icebergs. This invention laid the groundwork for the pulse-echo principle. This principle gained prominence after the tragic sinking of the Titanic in 1912 and subsequently found application in submarine detection during both World Wars. In 1940, a patent for metal defect detection was issued to Firestone, marking another crucial step in the evolution of ultrasound technology.

One of the most pivotal moments came in 1942 when Dussik produced the first transmission ultrasound image of a human. This achievement set the stage for the future of medical ultrasound imaging. The introduction of 2D (or B-mode) imaging in 1957 by Wild and Reid represented a major leap forward in ultrasound technology. Shortly after, in 1958, Donald advanced the field further by pioneering obstetric ultrasound. The year 1987 saw a remarkable development with von Ramm and Smith introducing 3D imaging, ushering in a new era of three-dimensional visualization.

The basic principle behind ultrasound imaging is relatively simple: emit a short ultrasound pulse and listen to what is reflected back. The time elapsed between emitting the pulse and receiving the response provides information about the distance at which the pulse was reflected. This technique assumes an average speed of sound in soft tissue, typically set at 1540 meters per second or 154,000 centimeters per second. Ultrasound imaging relies on detecting waves reflected from tissue structures. As these waves travel through the tissue, their energy gradually diminishes. The properties of the tissue itself determine the amount of energy reflected at each point, allowing us to create detailed images of internal structures for various medical and diagnostic purposes.

M-mode Imaging involves the acquisition of repeated A-scans while tracking a moving target. This method is particularly effective for measuring tissue motion. In contrast, B-mode Scanning, also known as 2D Imaging, is based on the principle of moving the A-mode transducer to different positions. By creating a 2D image from 1D lines, B-mode scanning requires a beam with good lateral resolution. Early B-mode Scanners, dating back to the 1960s, used a single circular transducer that was manually moved and mechanically tracked. The resulting image lines were stored on photographic film. Developments in image display in the 1970s introduced the analogue scan converter, which stored the maximum brightness without depending on exposure time. These images were displayed on a TV screen in real-time as they formed. Advancements in ultrasound technology have led to the development of 3D Ultrasound using Matrix Array Transducers. These transducers utilize a phased array with elements arranged in a 2D grid (matrix) and can steer and focus in all directions. The volume image is constructed from multiple lines, providing detailed three-dimensional information.

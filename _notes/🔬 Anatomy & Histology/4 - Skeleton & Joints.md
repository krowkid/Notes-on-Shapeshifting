###### **PART 1**
Bone and cartilage are specialized connective tissues that provide essential support and structure to the body.

Bones are strong, flexible, and semi-rigid tissue capable of withstanding compression forces. Comprised of osteocytes, type I collagen fibers, and an extracellular matrix, it contains various chemicals, including binding proteins and minerals. Notably, approximately 70% of bone consists of hydroxyapatite, a calcium phosphate compound. Bone can be categorized into two types: spongy (trabecular) bone with a lattice-like structure and compact bone, which forms the outer layer.

Cartilage, while also robust and flexible, is more pliable than bone, making it suitable for structures where movement is necessary. Composed of chondrocytes, type II collagen fibers, and an extracellular matrix with around 10% aggrecan and 75% water, cartilage comes in three types: hyaline, elastic, and fibrocartilage. Hyaline cartilage is the most common, found in areas such as the nose and joints; elastic cartilage contains elastic fibers and is located in the external ear, while fibrocartilage, rich in collagen fibers, is found in the intervertebral discs and knee joint.

Spongy bone, also called trabecular bone, possesses a lattice-like structure formed by thin trabeculae or spicules. These create a meshwork with spaces filled with bone marrow. This type of bone is typically found in the inner regions of bones, especially in the epiphyses of long bones and flat bones. It provides structural support while reducing bone weight, with trabeculae aligned along lines of stress for added strength.

Compact bone, or cortical bone, is dense and makes up the outer layer of bones. It comprises tightly packed cylindrical structures called osteons or Haversian systems. Each osteon consists of concentric layers known as lamellae, surrounding a central canal housing blood vessels and nerves. Osteocytes, mature bone cells, arrange in concentric circles around the central canal. Compact bone delivers strength, support, and protection to the bone and is highly vascularized, with blood vessels coursing through the central canals of the osteons.

Regarding cell composition, cartilage is primarily made up of chondrocytes, which maintain the extracellular matrix, crucial for support, flexibility, and shock absorption.

In contrast, bone consists of several cell types. Osteocytes serve as mature bone cells, while osteoblasts are responsible for bone formation, including synthesizing type I collagen fibers and other proteins. Osteoclasts play a role in bone resorption and remodeling. The extracellular matrix of bone includes type I collagen fibers, binding proteins, and minerals, with hydroxyapatite, a calcium phosphate compound, comprising about 70% of it. Osteocytes maintain bone tissue and oversee remodeling, osteoblasts create bone and mineralize it, while osteoclasts participate in bone resorption and remodeling.
###### **PART 2**
The skeleton is the bony framework that offers support, protection, and enables movement. It comprises two primary parts: the axial skeleton and the appendicular skeleton.

The axial skeleton includes the skull, vertebral column, ribs, and sternum. These bones shield vital organs like the brain, spinal cord, and heart while bearing the body's weight. The skull safeguards the brain, and the vertebral column shields the spinal cord. The rib cage, formed by the ribs and sternum, protects the heart and lungs.

The appendicular skeleton consists of limb bones and limb girdles. Limb bones like the humerus, radius, ulna, femur, tibia, and fibula provide support and aid movement. The limb girdles, namely the shoulder girdle (clavicle and scapula) and pelvic girdle (hip bones), link limb bones to the axial skeleton, offering stability and muscle attachment points.

Bones have functions beyond support and protection. They also serve as a reservoir for minerals, particularly calcium and phosphate. When blood calcium levels drop, calcium is released from bones to maintain normal levels. Conversely, when blood calcium levels are high, excess calcium is stored in the bones. Additionally, some bones, especially in the axial skeleton, participate in blood cell production through hematopoiesis.

In anatomy, various terms describe different bone features and structures to precisely convey their location, shape, and function.

One such term is "epiphysis," denoting the rounded ends of long bones, typically covered with articular cartilage, which contributes to joint formation.

Another term is "diaphysis," referring to the central, cylindrical part of long bones situated between the epiphyses.

In growing bones, the "metaphysis" is the region between the diaphysis and epiphysis, housing the growth plate (epiphyseal plate), responsible for longitudinal bone growth.

The "periosteum" is a dense connective tissue membrane enveloping the outer bone surface, providing protection, nourishment, and anchoring points for tendons and ligaments.

Within the diaphysis of long bones lies the "medullary cavity" (marrow cavity), containing bone marrow responsible for blood cell production.

Additional terms describe specific bone features, such as the "head" – a rounded knob-like structure at the proximal bone end, and the "condyle" – a rounded articular surface at the bone's end that forms a joint.
###### **PART 3**
In the human body, joints can be categorised into three primary types: fibrous joints, cartilaginous joints, and synovial joints.

Fibrous joints are characterised by dense regular connective tissue that links bones together, allowing minimal or no significant movement. There are three subtypes of fibrous joints. First, we have sutures, which are found in the skull and are formed by interlocking, serrated or beveled edges of the bones, providing stability and strength. An example is the sagittal suture along the midline of the skull. Second, syndesmoses are joints where ligaments or membranes connect bones, allowing limited movement. An example is the inferior tibiofibular joint, connecting the tibia and fibula. Lastly, gomphoses are peg-and-socket joints found in the teeth, with the roots anchored in the sockets of the maxilla and mandible by periodontal ligaments.

Cartilaginous joints, on the other hand, connect bones with cartilage, enabling limited movement. They are divided into two types. Synchondroses are primary cartilaginous joints with hyaline cartilage connecting bones. An example is the epiphyseal plate, allowing longitudinal bone growth in children. Symphyses are secondary cartilaginous joints where fibrocartilage connects bones, providing limited movement and acting as shock absorbers. The pubic symphysis, connecting the two pubic bones in the pelvis, is an example.

Synovial joints, the most common type, feature a joint cavity filled with synovial fluid and allow a wide range of movement. These joints are classified into six types based on their shape and movement characteristics.

In the structure and function of joints, capsular ligaments and intra-articular discs play crucial roles. Capsular ligaments, composed of dense connective tissue, reinforce joint capsules, limiting excessive movement and preventing dislocation. They also contain proprioceptors, sensory receptors that provide feedback to the central nervous system about joint position and movement. Intra-articular discs, or menisci, are fibrocartilaginous structures within some synovial joints. They act as shock absorbers, distribute forces evenly, enhance joint congruence and stability, and reduce friction within the joint.

These structural elements collectively contribute to joint stability, mobility, and function, safeguarding joint integrity, articular surfaces, and facilitating smooth, controlled movement. The interaction between various factors like articular shape, joint capsule, ligaments, muscles, and tendons determines joint stability. The articular shape of bones, the strength of the joint capsule, ligaments connecting bones, and muscles and tendons all play pivotal roles in supporting joints, limiting excessive movement, and ensuring their stability. It's important to note that the balance between stability and mobility varies between joints, with highly mobile joints often being less stable, while those prioritising stability may have a more limited range of motion.

# Passage
###### **PART 1**
The nervous system is divided into two main parts: the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord, which are enclosed in protective membranes called the meninges. The PNS is composed of all the other nerve tissues that lie outside the meninges. The CNS is further divided into the brain and spinal cord. The brain is subdivided into the brainstem and the cerebrum. The brainstem is a cylindrical portion that is continuous with the spinal cord, while the cerebrum is the upper expanded part of the brain.

The PNS is divided into the somatic and autonomic nervous systems. The somatic nervous system supplies skeletal muscle, serosa, connective tissues, and skin, while the autonomic nervous system supplies smooth and cardiac muscle, as well as exocrine glands. The autonomic nervous system is further divided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. The sympathetic system activates the body when stressed and controls fight or flight responses. It uses nor-adrenaline (nor-epinephrine) as a neurotransmitter. On the other hand, the parasympathetic system is activated during relaxed situations and is sometimes called the "rest and digest" system. It uses acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter.

The brain is a complex organ that plays a crucial role in controlling and coordinating the body's functions. It is composed of both grey matter and white matter. Grey matter refers to the regions of the brain that contain the cell bodies of neurons. It appears grey in color due to the accumulation of cell bodies and lacks myelin, a fatty substance that surrounds and insulates nerve fibers. Grey matter is responsible for processing information and carrying out the functions of the brain. It is found in the outer layer of the brain, known as the cortex, and in deeper regions called nuclei. White matter, on the other hand, consists of bundles of nerve fibers called axons. These axons are coated with myelin, which gives them a white appearance. 

White matter serves as a communication network, allowing different regions of grey matter to connect and exchange information. It facilitates the transmission of signals between different parts of the brain and between the brain and the rest of the body. The distribution of grey and white matter in the brain is not uniform. In the cerebral cortex, grey matter is found on the surface, while white matter lies deeper within the brain. In contrast, in the spinal cord, grey matter is located centrally, forming an H-shaped structure, while white matter surrounds it.

Nuclei and ganglia are terms used to describe collections of nerve cell bodies in the nervous system. Nuclei refer to groups of nerve cell bodies that are located within the central nervous system (CNS). These nuclei are typically found in the deeper regions of the brain and spinal cord. They play important roles in processing and integrating information within the CNS. Examples of nuclei include the basal ganglia, which are involved in motor control, and the thalamic nuclei, which relay sensory information to the cerebral cortex. Ganglia, on the other hand, are collections of nerve cell bodies that are located outside the CNS. They are typically found in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Ganglia serve as relay stations for transmitting signals between the CNS and various parts of the body. Examples of ganglia include the posterior root ganglia, which contain the cell bodies of sensory neurons, and the paravertebral ganglia, which are part of the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system.
###### **PART 2**
A typical neuron consists of several key components. The main features of a neuron include the cell body, dendrites, axons, and synapses. The cell body, also known as the soma, is the central part of the neuron. It contains the nucleus and other organelles necessary for the neuron's metabolic functions. The cell body is responsible for producing neurotransmitters, which are chemical messengers that transmit signals between neurons. Dendrites are branching extensions that emanate from the cell body. They receive incoming signals from other neurons and transmit them to the cell body. Dendrites provide a large surface area for connecting with other neurons and play a crucial role in integrating and processing incoming information.

The axon is a long, slender projection that extends from the cell body. It carries electrical impulses, known as action potentials, away from the cell body and towards other neurons or target cells. The axon is covered by a fatty substance called myelin, which acts as an insulating layer and speeds up the transmission of electrical signals. At the end of the axon, there are specialized structures called synapses. Synapses are the points of communication between neurons. They consist of a presynaptic terminal, which is the end of the axon, and a postsynaptic terminal, which is the receiving end of another neuron or target cell. Neurotransmitters are released from the presynaptic terminal and bind to receptors on the postsynaptic terminal, transmitting the signal from one neuron to the next.

The glial cells of the central nervous system (CNS) include oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, microglia, and ependymal cells. Oligodendrocytes are responsible for forming myelin sheaths around the axons in the CNS. They provide insulation and support to the nerve fibers, allowing for faster and more efficient transmission of electrical signals. Astrocytes are the most abundant glial cells in the CNS. They have numerous functions, including providing structural support to neurons, regulating the microenvironment around neurons, and participating in the formation of the blood-brain barrier. Astrocytes also play a role in recycling neurotransmitters and storing nutrients for neurons. Microglia are the immune defense cells of the CNS. They act as macrophages, engulfing and removing cellular debris, pathogens, and waste products. Microglia also have other functions that are still being discovered. Ependymal cells line the central canal of the spinal cord and the ventricles of the brain. They assist in producing, maintaining, and monitoring cerebrospinal fluid, which acts as a protective cushion for the brain and spinal cord. Ependymal cells have cilia on their surface that help circulate the cerebrospinal fluid.

Somatosensory nerves transmit sensory information from the body's surface, muscles, joints, and tendons to the central nervous system. They are responsible for sensations such as touch, pressure, temperature, and pain. Viscerosensory nerves transmit sensory information from the internal organs, such as the heart, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract, to the central nervous system. They detect sensations related to the functioning and condition of the organs, such as pain or discomfort.

Somatomotor nerves control voluntary movements of skeletal muscles. They transmit signals from the central nervous system to the muscles, allowing us to perform purposeful movements. Parasympathetic and sympathetic motor neurons: Parasympathetic and sympathetic motor neurons are part of the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary functions of the body. Parasympathetic motor neurons regulate activities during rest and relaxation, such as digestion and slowing heart rate. Sympathetic motor neurons, on the other hand, activate the body's "fight or flight" response, preparing it for action in response to stress or danger

Unipolar neurons have a single process emerging from the cell body, which then splits into two branches. One branch carries sensory information from the periphery to the central nervous system, while the other branch carries the information away from the cell body. Unipolar neurons are commonly found in sensory pathways. Multipolar neurons have multiple dendrites that receive signals from other neurons and a single axon that transmits signals away from the cell body. Most neurons in the central nervous system and motor neurons are multipolar neurons. They are involved in transmitting motor signals and integrating information within the central nervous system. Bipolar neurons have a single dendrite and a single axon that extend from opposite ends of the cell body. They are relatively rare but are found in specialized sensory systems, such as the eye's retina and the nose's olfactory epithelium. Bipolar neurons are involved in transmitting sensory information.

Upper motor neurons (UMNs) are motor neurons that originate in the motor region of the cerebral cortex or in the brainstem. They carry motor information down to the lower motor neurons. UMNs are responsible for influencing the excitability and output of the lower motor neurons. They play a crucial role in the initiation and coordination of voluntary movements. Lower motor neurons (LMNs) are motor neurons located in either the anterior horn of the spinal cord or the cranial nerve nuclei of the brainstem. Axon terminals from LMNs innervate skeletal muscles, producing movements of the trunk, limbs, eyes, face, and tongue. LMNs are the final pathway through which motor signals from the central nervous system are transmitted to the muscles, allowing for voluntary movement.

1st order sensory neurons are located in the peripheral nervous system. They are responsible for conducting sensory information from the sensory receptors (such as touch, pressure, or temperature receptors) to the central nervous system. They transmit this information to the 2nd order sensory neurons. 2nd order sensory neurons are located in the spinal cord or brainstem. They receive input from the 1st order sensory neurons and transmit the sensory information to higher centers in the brain for further processing. The 2nd order sensory neurons relay the information from the peripheral sensory receptors to the thalamus. 3rd order sensory neurons are located in the thalamus, which is a relay station in the brain. They receive input from the 2nd order sensory neurons and transmit the sensory information to the appropriate sensory cortex in the brain for conscious perception and interpretation. The 3rd order sensory neurons are responsible for relaying the processed sensory information to the cerebral cortex.
###### **PART 3**
The peripheral nerves are organized into bundles of nerve fibers surrounded by connective tissue. The outer layer of this tissue is called the "epineurium," which is dense and provides protection. Each bundle of nerve fibers, known as a fascicle, is enclosed in a sleeve of less dense tissue called the "perineurium." The individual nerve fibers are surrounded by a small amount of loose connective tissue called the "endoneurium." Blood vessels are usually found in the epineurium and perineurium, providing a network of capillary vessels in the endoneurium 

Myelinated axons are nerve fibers that are surrounded by a fatty substance called myelin. Myelin acts as an insulating layer, allowing for faster and more efficient transmission of electrical signals along the axon. The myelin sheath is formed by specialized cells called oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system. The gaps in the myelin sheath, known as nodes of Ranvier, allow for saltatory conduction, where the electrical signal jumps from one node to the next, increasing the speed of signal transmission. Myelinated axons are found in both motor and sensory pathways and play a crucial role in the proper functioning of the nervous system.

Nerve fibers can be classified based on their size and conduction velocities. The classification scheme developed by Erlanger and Gasser divides fibers into three types: A, B, and C. Type A fibers are further subdivided into alpha, beta, gamma, and delta fibers.

1. **A-alpha fibers**: These are the largest and most heavily myelinated fibers. They are responsible for transmitting motor signals from the upper motor neurons in the brain to the lower motor neurons in the spinal cord, which then innervate skeletal muscles.
2. **A-beta fibers**: These fibers are smaller in diameter compared to A-alpha fibers but are still myelinated. They are involved in transmitting touch, pressure, and proprioceptive sensory information 
3. **A-gamma fibers**: These fibers are smaller in diameter than A-beta fibers and are also myelinated. They are responsible for transmitting signals from the upper motor neurons to the muscle spindles, which are sensory receptors in muscles that detect changes in muscle length.
4. **A-delta fibers**: These fibers are smaller in diameter compared to A-gamma fibers and are lightly myelinated. They transmit sensory information related to touch, pain, and temperature 

B fibers are smaller myelinated fibers with a diameter of less than 2 micrometers. They are involved in the autonomic nervous system and transmit signals related to involuntary functions such as regulating heart rate, blood pressure, and digestion. C fibers are unmyelinated fibers and have the smallest diameter. They transmit sensory information related to pain, temperature, and other sensations. C fibers are slower in conducting signals compared to A and B fibers

Sensory nerve endings are specialized structures located in the skin and other tissues that detect various sensory stimuli such as touch, pressure, temperature, and pain. These nerve endings are connected to sensory neurons, which transmit the sensory information to the central nervous system for processing and interpretation. Proprioceptive nerve endings, on the other hand, are sensory receptors located within muscles, tendons, and joints. They provide feedback to the central nervous system about the position, movement, and tension of our body parts. Proprioception helps us maintain balance, coordinate movements, and have a sense of body awareness

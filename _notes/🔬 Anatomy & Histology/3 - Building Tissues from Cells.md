# Passage
Epithelial cells exhibit a set of distinct characteristics that define their role in the body. These characteristics contribute to their function and structure, facilitating various vital processes.

Firstly, epithelial cells are known for their ability to form dense cellular sheets, creating continuous layers that serve as protective barriers. These tightly packed cells act as a shield against external factors and play a crucial role in maintaining tissue integrity.

Secondly, unlike many other cell types, epithelial cells do not possess their own blood vessels. Instead, they rely on adjacent blood vessels in the underlying connective tissue to supply them with oxygen, nutrients, and essential molecules. This reliance on diffusion highlights the intimate connection between epithelial cells and their surroundings.

Furthermore, epithelial cells anchor themselves to the underlying connective tissue through a structure known as the basal lamina complex. This complex provides support and separation between the epithelium and the connective tissue, ensuring the stability and integrity of the tissue layers.

Epithelial cells also exhibit polarity, with distinct apical and basolateral aspects. The apical surface faces either the external environment or a lumen, while the basolateral surface makes contact with the underlying connective tissue. This polarity is essential for their specialized functions.

Moreover, these cells can develop specialized structures to fulfil specific roles. Examples include microvilli for absorption, cilia for movement, and goblet cells for mucus secretion, each tailored to specific physiological requirements.

Epithelial cells are further classified based on their shape, with squamous (flat and thin), cuboidal (cube-shaped), and columnar (tall and rectangular) variations. These shapes correspond to their roles in diffusion and filtration, secretion and absorption, and further underscore their diverse functions.

Their arrangement also defines epithelial types, with simple (single layer), pseudostratified (single layer of varying heights), and stratified (multiple layers) categories. These arrangements dictate functions such as absorption, secretion, filtration, and protection against mechanical and chemical stresses.

Stratified squamous epithelium, a subset of stratified epithelium, can be divided into two types: non-keratinizing and keratinized. In non-keratinizing epithelium, superficial cells remain alive and retain their nuclei, offering protection in moist areas of the body. In contrast, keratinized epithelium features superficial cells that are dead and filled with keratin, lacking nuclei. This adaptation occurs in areas exposed to air, such as the skin, providing a robust, waterproof barrier against mechanical stress, pathogens, and dehydration.

Cell junctions in epithelial cells perform essential functions that are pivotal for the maintenance of tissue integrity and function. These junctions can be broadly categorized into anchoring junctions and non-anchoring junctions, each with its own distinct structural features and functions.

Anchoring junctions serve as the adhesive forces that tightly bind epithelial sheets together. Within this category, there are three key types: desmosomes, hemidesmosomes, and adherens junctions.

Desmosomes and hemidesmosomes function as robust anchors, allowing epithelial sheets to flex without the risk of tearing. These junctions employ membrane-spanning proteins to either link adjacent cells or connect cells to the underlying matrix. Their strength is vital for maintaining the structural integrity of epithelial tissues.

Adherens junctions, on the other hand, are accumulations of transmembrane cadherin protein dimers. These cadherin proteins bind homophilically to identical cadherin proteins on neighboring cells. Adherens junctions are linked to actin filaments, providing crucial structural support.

Non-anchoring junctions encompass tight junctions and gap junctions, each with distinct functions.

Tight junctions create a seal between adjacent cells, forming a barrier that prevents the passage of even the smallest molecules across the intercellular space. These junctions are constructed from transmembrane proteins like claudin and occludin and play a central role in maintaining the selective barrier and polarity of epithelial cells.

Gap junctions, in contrast, enable the exchange of small molecules between the cytoplasm of neighboring cells. These junctions feature hydrophilic pores that facilitate the movement of molecules with a mass of less than approximately 1x10^3 Daltons between cells. This function is crucial for intercellular communication.

Adherens junctions are particularly noteworthy for their role in connecting adjacent epithelial cells. They achieve this by binding cadherin proteins homophilically. This binding forms a potent adhesive link between cells.

Internally, adherens junctions are connected to actin filaments through actin-associated proteins like p120 and catenin proteins. These actin filaments span across adherens junctions, delivering structural support and stability to both the junctions and the entire epithelial sheet.

The association between adherens junctions and actin filaments enables the transmission of mechanical forces between cells. This capability allows the epithelial sheet to withstand mechanical stress and maintain its structural integrity. Moreover, the actin cytoskeleton linked to adherens junctions also participates in cell signaling and the regulation of cell behavior.
